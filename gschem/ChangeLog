    gschem: Update the clipboard menu item sensitivities asynchronously
    
    Spawning a sub-main loop to do this can cause reentrancy problems due
    to processing of other X events from within the sub-main loop.
    
    This could end up with states changing whilst updating menus, and
    this has been noted to cause crashes whilst moving objects.

    gschem: Rework how clipboards are cleaned up.
    
    Detach selection monitoring callback when deletting a window. The
    callback userdata passes the GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL we're busy freeing,
    causing a crash.
    
    We also need to ensure the clipboard manager (if any) takes our data
    before we free things, so explicitly call gtk_clipboard_store() during
    cleanup if we still own the selection.
    
    Add some code to track when we own the selection, including explicitly
    clearing the clipboard before setting new contents - to avoid a race
    between a clip_clear callback for our old selection, and the new data.

    Enable basic clipboard support.
    
    Enable clipboard support using the GTK Clipboard API.  gschem
    advertises 'application/x-geda-schematic' data, and transfers it in
    the gEDA on-disc file format.
    
    This works between gschem instances, but data does not remain in the
    clipboard after the advertising instance of gschem exits.

    Sometimes we may want to save or read in a list of objects which isn't
    the current page. This adds a new function o_save_curr_page() which
    behaves the same as o_save() previously did.

    If libgeda fails to locate the gEDA data directory, show a dialog

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    Refactor finding paths for config etc.
    
    This is intended to provide a centralised place for determining the
    paths more "smartly" in the future (e.g. for platforms with different
    conventions on where config should go).
    
    Only user-visible change should be that log messages when loading
    config files no longer hardcode "~/.gEDA".

    Darkened the outline colors of objects that are being dragged/modified
    
    The outline colors should be different than the default colors.
    Previously the XOR rendering made the outlines look differently, but with
    cairo rendering the dragged objects look exactly the same as non-dragged
    objects.  This patch darkens the outline colors in the dark colormap only.

    gschem: Calculate radius of centered arcs and boxes with 2x precision
    
    Since we may have to hint the radius by 0.5px to bring it onto the
    pixel grid, we will get better results if we compute the radius to
    half-pixel precision.
    
    Re-enable radius hinting for centered arcs back on, but only for arcs
    which have radius > 1px to start with. If we don't, there is an abrupt
    transition between when the arc lights a single pixel, and when it is
    the next largest size. A little anti-aliasing in that case helps.

    gschem: fill type dialog: improved default values
    
    If the user changes the fill type from HOLLOW to HATCHED and does not
    define the angle and pitch, then the gschem could either reject
    the change of the type, or guess the pitch values.
    
    I've decided that it is better to set the missing values.
    
    In the opposite case, when the user switches the type from HATCHED to
    HOLLOW, the pitch is still set. Reset the not required parameters
    to -1.
    
    Maybe the functionality should be moved to o_set_fill_type() in
    libgeda.

    gschem: Clamp minimum size to draw stoke dots using cairo, apply hinting (Rest!)
    
    Activate the code partially committed in the last commit, and add the
    remaining code to hint the position of dots in a stroke.
    
    Since cairo uses antialiased drawings, a dot of diameter 1px will actually
    render ligher than it would have with GDK. Once the line width reaches 1px
    switch back to drawing dots as squares.
    
    Also add hinting to the position of the drawn dots drawn along the stroke
    to ensure they land centered on pixels.

    gschem: Make gschem_cairo_* functions take parameters in world coordinates.
    
    This changes the prototype of all gschem_cairo_* functions to take a
    GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL parameter rather than cairo_t as their first argument.
    
    This change cuts down a significant number of lines of code, and also
    paves the way to having world-coordinates passed straight into the cairo
    routines, should we want to use cairo for printing at some stage.
    
    A few cases of direct cairo usage in screen coordinates remain; these are
    in o_cue.c, and x_grid.c. The case in o_cue.c remains because it relates
    to a filled box. gschem_cairo_box () hints the path coordinates for a
    stroked box and clamps the minimum on-screen stroke width to 1px, thus
    rendering it unsuitable for hinting a path to be filled.

    gschem: Add new primitves to draw a centered arc and box
    
    These primitives take care of hinting specifically to keep the drawn
    object looking centered, adjusting to take into account both the
    radius / extents of the object being drawn, and how the object we're
    trying to center on would have been hinted.
    
    Use these new primitives for drawing cues and grip boxes.

    gschem_cairo_box(): Allow passing line_width as -1 to switch off hinting
    
    This may be useful for drawing a box path which is to be filled. If at
    some point, gschem_cairo_* were to take 0 line-width as instruction to
    draw "hardware" type lines, passing 0 to avoid hinting would clash with
    that feature.
    
    When the line_width is passed as -1, an extra pixel is added to the
    larger X and Y coordinates, so the fill touches the pixel which would
    be lit if a line was drawn at the passed coordinates.

    gschem: Refactor partially duplicated drawing code in various files.
    
    For each object type, there is drawing code for the normal object
    on the page, an object being placed, and objects being rubberbanded.
    
    In many cases (arc, circle and path being good examples), each of these
    functions repeat non-trivial amounts of very similar setup and drawing
    code. Only the line-width, stroke style need to be specific to each.
    
    Refactor the code such that the place and rubberbanding routines (which
    adjust the rendered geometry based on state variables) construct a
    temporary object with the modified geometry. Common parts of the cairo
    setup and path generation can be combined and shared between routines.

    gschem: Revert change in cue size "fixed" when introducing bus pins.
    
    The old behaviour was intentional.. smaller cues were in fact supposed
    to be used for buses, so that the dot was contained inside the bus
    graphic.
    
    Rename the variables defining the sizes to be clear about their purpose.

    gschem: Adjust position hinting when drawing round junction cues
    
    Apply hinting to the cue's position to match the position of the object
    it is sitting on. This is done by passing the on-screen width (pixels)
    of a net / bus into gschem_cairo_arc(). If the line-width is odd, that
    function will shift the origin of the arc by 0.5px. Refactor the places
    where we draw circular arcs to use a single helper function in o_cue.c

    gschem: Fix rubberbanding of arcs with negative end_angles
    
    Such arcs are typically generated by mirroring. If the arc being
    rubberbanded previously had a negative sweep, keep that the case
    in the rubberbanded version.
    
    Also fixes a bug where we're rubberband to give a zero degree sweep
    arc rather than a 360 degree one.

    Add a cancel function o_grips_cancel() to reset that property in the
    case where grip modification is prematurely terminated.

    This allows schematic diagrams of hierarchical connections to include
    buses. Since gnetlist does not currently support buses, this feature is
    useful only for diagrams, or when used with a custom netlister.
    
    Since we don't want to mislead users into thinking bus pins netlist,
    the option to set pin type is only present on the page's popup menu,
    and is marked "(graphical)".

    gschem's canvas can have a fractionally different X and Y scale factor

    This ought to improve performance. Since the hatch lines are drawn
    in parallel, the path doesn't self-intersect, and we can gain a speed
    increase by sending the whole operation in one go. (Self-intersection,
    e.g. in the case of a grid would slow cairo down computing the mask
    to render with).

    gschem: Adjust hinting of lines to include an extra overlapping pixel
    
    When drawing using GDK, a span of pixels being rendered in a line would
    light all pixels touched by the span.
    
    Since moving to cairo, our hinting code has rounded the line's end-points
    to land between pixels. (So cairo paints the whole pixel), however it
    means that there is one pixel less being painted (as both ends are
    adjusted in the same direction).
    
    Fix this with a manual addition of 1px as appropriate to the coordinates
    such that an extra pixel is hit for horizontal and vertical lines.
    
    This now means that a line drawn between two grid positions will acually
    be drawn on top of both of those grid lines, rather than being drawn on
    top of one, and just touching the other.
    
    Apply the offset factor (0 or 0.5px) to both X and Y coordinate pairs for
    non horizontal / vertical lines, since that gives better alignment with
    the grid.
    
    Apply the same hinting to round capped lines as to square capped.

    gschem: Attempt better hinted alignment when drawing arcs.
    
    gschem's canvas can have a fractionally different X and Y scale factor
    in some cases, which can cause misalignment of arcs drawn assuming the
    scale factors are uniform. This manifests because at high zoom levels,
    the center of an arc can be a large distance from the drawn stroke,
    over which distance the scaling errors magnify to give a visible offset.
    
    The other adjustment made here is rather than hinting the center of the
    arc to the pixel grid, we take the case where the arc forms a full circle,
    then find the center (in floating point screen coordinates) which would
    align the tangent of the arc at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degree positions, to
    lines hinted to the pixel grid at those positions.
    
    A 0.5px offset correction made in gschem_cairo_arc() to the arc center,
    for odd stroke width accounts for lining up the those tangents with
    the hinting which is applied to odd width lines in gschem_cairo_line().

    need that these functions must use XOR drawing to the screen.

    gschem: Improve clarity of text rendering by turning its origin mark off
    
    The origin mark is now only drawn when text is selected, and the mark its
    self is greater than a certain size on screen. This allows us to retain
    the mark's utility in checking text is correctly aligned.

    This makes the major squares less obtrusive on the page, whilst
    still retaining a visible distinction to the minor lines.

    For now, these menu entries are hard-coded to the colour scheme files
    which we ship. It would be nice in the future (when menus are reworked),
    to add these options from a registered list of colour schemes.

    gschem: Use cairo rendering for the mesh grid
    
    Since we're grouping the stroking of all horizonal lines into a
    single command, and all vertical lines into another, this has the
    potential to be drawn quicker by the X11 server.
    
    NB: If the horizontal and vertical lines were to be grouped
        together into a single path, a large slowdown in incurred
        as cairo computes their intersections.

    This not only gives a more correct colour, but fixes a large performance
    bottle-neck where an alpha value of 0xFF would lead to a cairo alpha !=
    1.0, triggering far slower translucent rendering code-paths.

    gschem: New helper function to query rendered grid spacing.
    
    The status bar contains an label which lists the current rendered grid
    spacing. We should not be forcing an update of this each time we repaint
    a portion of the grid. Introduce a helper function to ask the grid code
    what size it would end up drawing. This will then allow us to query the
    rendered grid size after zoom / grid settings changes, and update there.

    is currently just dotted grids or nothing.
    
    Adds doxygen documentation for the grid drawing functions.

    Remove GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL and TOPLEVEL indirection for fixed colour indices
    
    Colour indices such as grid_colour and select_color are not changed at
    run-time since (by definition) those graphic elements are always drawn
    with the sepcified index. Remove the indirection through GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL
    or TOPLEVEL, and use the appropriate index constant instead.
    
    The background_color indirection remains, since swapping this is used
    to override the background to white when exporting black and white image.

    Fix attribute colours for embedded objects [#2157598]
    
    Add an argument, "set_color" to o_attrib_attach[_list]() to specify
    whether the colour of the attribute should be reset to the default
    attribute colour when performing the attachment.
    
    We set this to true when promoting toplevel unattached attributes
    inside a symbol onto the schematic page, when the user explicitly
    attaches an attribute inside gschem. It is FALSE in other cases.
    
    In cases where we're creating new attributes, such as o_slot_end(),
    we specify the attribute colour we want to o_text_new().
    
    Remove colour setting from o_attrib_add(), since there is no point
    having this code in two places. o_attrib_add() just deals with the
    datastructures now.

    colors.h defines a number of color index index constants with color
    names (white, black, cyan, etc.) This is evil and bad, because the
    color map might actually be loaded with entirely different colors.
    
    This also adds a DEFAULT_COLOR macro, usable in most places the "evil"
    existing contacts are used.

    structures, store them as a set of four 8-bit unsigned integers.

    Add explicit 'enabled' field to COLOR structure.
    
    Colors are implicitly 'enabled' by having values specified in the
    configuration file. Up until now, whether a given color is enabled has
    been checked by checking if the color name strings are NULL.
    
    This patch adds an explicit 'enabled' field to the COLOR structure. It
    is set TRUE when s_color_request() is called for that color index.

    gschem: Make rubberbanding operations use the invalidate / expose model
    
    Introduce a new function for each rubberbanding operation,
    o_*_invaldate_rubber() which invalidates an on-screen area matching
    the area where the rubberbanding operation would paint.
    
    The actual drawing happens from the expose handler, which already
    had appropriate code to ensure any damaged rubberband objects were
    re-painted during an expose event.

    We're probably invalidating more than we need to in some cases,
    since just invalidating a single object will be enough to update
    any cues it is touching. We don't really need to invalidate its
    connected objects as well.

    Adding to the invalidated region cures screen artifacts left due
    to the bounds of an object not including the area occupied by its
    rubberbanding grips.
    
    Adding to the coordinates used with s_page_objects_in_region() ensures
    that grips / cues from adjacent objects are drawn correctly when repainting
    a damaged region from the expose handler.
    
    This is a bit of a hack and could be better catered for by invalidating
    the grip regions separately from an object specific invalidate function.
    s_page_objects_in_region() would also have to return objects with grips
    or cues touching the passed region.

    Symbols now selectable by clicking inside their shapes.
    
    This patch changes the selection behavior by allowing symbols to
    be selected by clicking inside any contained shape.  This behavior
    works for symbols with boxes, circles, and paths.
    
    Patch modified by Peter Clifton:
    
      Added m_line_shortest_distance(), (m_line.c) and make use of that
      in m_polygon_shortest_distance() rather than faking a line OBJECT.
    
      Change all o_*_shortest_distance() functions to take a parameter
      "force_solid" so we avoid having to use a specialised dispatch
      function to treat constituent primitive objects inside a COMPLEX
      as solid.

    o_move_end_rubberband(): Rework creating connectivity lists. Fix #2017356
    
    We were previously making a lists of pre- and post-move connected objects
    incrementally as we moved each individual object being stretched.
    
    In some cases this meant that as we moved one object, we artifically
    changed the connectivity of future ones to be moved, making the
    resulting connectivity lists inaccurate. In some examples, the objects
    being stretched themselves appeared in the lists.
    
    We want to avoid this, since if we delete a stretched object when
    it reaches zero length, we don't want that object to be referenced in
    the list of connected objects. Since we don't want to do more work
    than necessary re-drawing affected objects on screen, it is generally
    desirable to keep the lists as accurate as possible.
    
    To avoid the problem with incremental updates, build the connectivity
    lists before and after the entire move operation for stretched objects.
    
    This alone doesn't fix the case where a stretched object being deleted
    happens to touch another to start with. We have to check when deleting
    an object for its presence in the prev_conn_objects list. We check and
    remove _all_ references to the deleted object from that list.
    
    Thanks go to Patrick Bernaud for the test-case for this very tricky to
    reproduce bug, and an initial patch.

    gschem: Remove stretched object from stretch list if we delete it
    
    When a stretched object becomes zero length when rubberbanding, we
    delete it. We must also remember to delete it from the stretch list,
    otherwise it will be referenced later, and could cause a crash.
    
    NB: This isn't the whole story.. the before / after connectivity
        lists can still reference the deleted object and cause a crash.

    Use (rubber_visible == 0) to avoid "undrawing" invisible objects.
    
    For some operations, such as text and component placement, there is a
    gap between inserting components into the place buffer (at 0,0) and
    knowing where to draw them.
    
    This is presently handled with separate one-shot states used to special
    case the first mouse event recieved. These states are transitioned from
    as soon as the first drawing operation has been made. If we track the
    fact that no "undrawing" should take place, it's otherwise OK to use the
    same motion event handler for the first and subsequent motions.

    Remove linkage between OBJECTs and use GList for OBJECTs on the page
    
    This affords quite a lot of code clean-up, since we no longer have to
    maintain two versions of each operation which works on lists.

    When the override_color is set, we are likely to be erasing the control
    lines inside o_erase_single(). To avoid leaving artifacts, don't use
    the XOR drawing context in this case.

    NB: We can't just use g_get_home_dir() on its own without changing

    in the passwd file, over $HOME, so we try looking for the HOME env.
    variable first.
    
    BUT: some places in gEDA do just call g_get_home_dir() directly.
    Ideally we should tidy these up to be consistent at some point.

    gschem: fix select state when double clicking an object
    
    After the o_edit() call in x_event_button_pressed() the state is
    STARTSELECT.  If a MODAL dialog is called (arc or change picture) the
    state will will still be STARTSELECT after closing the dialog.
    
    This state turns into the MOVE state right after the dialog is closed
    and the first motion is done in gschem (x_event_motion()).
    
    This is not correct. The state needs to be reset to SELECT right after
    the o_edit() call.

    gschem: Allow attribute value column in component selector to shrink
    
    Symbols with long values are common, and we don't want having viewed
    those to force a h-scroll-bar on symbols with short valued attributes.
    
    If we don't allow them to shrink, the columns retain the width of the
    largest item they displayed, and we often get stuck with a scroll bar
     after displaying components with lengthy attribute values.
    
    When updating the model, invalidate the column width for the attribute
    value column so it is re-sized based on the new data being shown.
    
    We might also consider invalidating the attribute name columns,
    however that gives an inconsistent column division when swithing
    between symbols, which doesn't look nice. For now, assume that
    the name column can keep the max width gained whilst previewing.

    gschem: Don't override GtkDialog default positioning in compselect dialog
    
    The old code explictly overrode the window positioning hint set by the
    GtkDialog (GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER_ON_PARENT) to GTK_WIN_POS_NONE.
    
    For people with multi-screen setups, the GtkDialog default is
    probably a better choice. We might in the future consider
    GTK_WIN_POS_MOUSE, where the windows appears at the current
    mouse position.
    
    In either case, this only affects a user's inital usage of the
    dialog as its geometry is saved to disk for later re-use.

    It isn't gauranteed that the result of getenv can't get modified at
    some point after the call (e.g. by another call to getenv), and testing

    corrupted at some point.
    
    Take a g_strdup() of the string immediately, so we don't have to worry.
    
    Since capitalised variable names should really be reserved for #define'd
    constants, rename "TMP" to tmp_path.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    When using the grips to modify an arc, then always unsnapped coords
    have been used. There two reasons to remove that:
    
    * it's a special case that is not neccessary as the user can easily
      switch off the snapping to get the unsnapped behaviour
    
    * with snapped arcs it's easier to draw 45 and 90 arcs

    which uses it to simply pass color indices around instead. Note that
    the results of s_color_get_index() were never actually *used* in the
    existing code.

    Validate calls to scm_c_eval_string(). [2105219]
    
    Because the reporter's version of Guile is broken, a lovely garbage
    collector segfault occurs if a null string is passed to
    scm_c_eval_string().
    
    For now, wrap all calls to scm_c_eval_string() with mutable arguments
    in g_scm_c_eval_string_protected(), and since the latter function
    seems to behave when passed a NULL string this bug should just go
    away.

    gschem: redraw empty preview on configure events [#2159047]
    
    If the preview widget contained an empty page, the redraw failed. In
    the preview_event_configure() function the function a_zoom_extents()
    returns without drawing if there are no objects on the page. Thus I've
    added a complement logic to redraw the background of the preview if
    required.

    gschem: code and test file for the net selection patch
    
    This commit adds the main functionality to gschem. The new function
    o_select_connected_nets() will select nets depending on the configured
    net_selection_mode and the current net_selection_state.
    
    The implementation uses two stacks for traversing the connections. The
    netnames stack contains all connected netnames and the net stack
    contains a collection of all currently collected nets.
    
    Note: The search for the netnames is very expensive, because of the
    required search of all netnames in all objects.
    The default net_selection_mode in system-gschemrc is set to "enable-net",
    only the directly connected nets are selected.
    
    The functionality can be testet with the test schematic
    tests/net_selection.sch.
    
    This patches are based on the work of Franz Mottas [1895538].

    Added code to do something more sane when trying to print tabs
    
    Previously if a tab character was encountered in a text string, the
    postscript output code would output a Y with a dot on top.  This is
    clearly not a tab character.  The patch adds explict handling of the tab
    character to output 8 spaces instead.  Not perfect, but better behavior
    than before.

    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Some cases were fixed by using g_strdup instead of g_strdup_printf(),
    some simply replace printf() for puts().

    Add support for arbitrary paths (filled and unfilled)
    
    The data-structures and on-disk format (which utiliseSVG style path
    strings) support stright line and bezier curve segments. Paths can be
    closed or open, and store line style and fill information in common with
    other geda objects.
    
    The path string parser is based on (slightly modified) code from librsvg
    version 2.22.2 (LGPL). Code from rsvg-path.c and rsvg-bpath-util.c
    (Copyright (C) 2000 Eazel, Inc.) was combined to form libgeda/src/s_path.c.
    These have been modified to use gEDA defined path data structures.
    
    The rendering implementation is based upon a small porion of the function
    rsvg_cairo_render_path (..) from rsvg-cairo-draw.c
    
    The parser still retains support the full richness of SVG path strings,
    although all instructions are subsequently normalised on to move, line, bezier
    and "close path" records. This support retained for convenience when entering
    artwork (which can be copied from an SVG editor). When saved, normalised paths
    are written out.
    
    The current rendering and shortest-distance computations are limited to
    straight line segments. Bezier segments, where encountered are treated
    as a straight line between their two endpoints.

    This is necessary for grip manipulation of more complex OBJECT types

    path can't conveniently be stashed in the GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL variables
    such as first_w{x,y}, second_w{x,y} etc., we need to reference the
    OBJECT and grip being manipulated from the drawing functions which
    are outside o_grips.c.

    gschem: Don't add invalid attributes to the multiattrib dialog list
    
    Since we can't edit them, don't treat them as attributes.
    
    Gschem validates attributes upon creation, so an invalid attribute
    attached to an object must come from a hand-edited file, or a text
    object which has been attached to an object. (Validation that the
    text item is a valid attribute isn't performed in that code-path).
    
    In the future we might want to add validation of attributes at
    file-load and at before attaching text OBJECTs to a COMPLEX.

    gschem: Fix left/right scroll events to move the schematic left/right.
    
    Commit which broke this was 048bd6f8e2fc1c5f5b01ff3f1cad3a7c9bf43f3e.
    
    Looks like I broke the behaviour when I refactored the x_event_scroll()
    to support a more "gtk" style modifier binding as well as the classic
    gschem behaviour. The refactored code inadvertently lumped up/down and
    left/right scroll events together as if they were up/down events.
    
    Up/down scroll events retain their existing behaviour and act according
    to the (scroll-wheel "{gtk|classic}") configuration setting. Left/right
    scroll events now always scroll the schematic left and right,
    irrespective of modifier key.

    Move calls to attribute promotion code from inside o_complex_add()
    
    Previously o_complex_add() would perform attribute promotion or delete /
    hide eligible attributes depending on the "attribute_promotion" argument
    passed to o_complex_add(). Break these into separate operations:
    
    1. Get / add to OBJECT list, a single complex object with o_complex_add().
       This object has its prim_objs exactly as the symbol exists on disk.
    2. EITHER:
         Promote the eligible attribtues with o_complex_promote_attribs().
         (For GList based processing use o_complex_get_promotable(), attach
          the returned objects as attribs and place in the appropriate GList.)
       OR:
         Delete / hide eligible attributes with
         o_complex_remove_promotable_attribs()
    
    All behaviour relating to attribute promotion should be identical after
    this commit. If not, it is a bug should be reported. (This includes the
    insertion order of the OBJECT and it's attributes into the object list).

    gschem: Only add nets and buses to the stretch list. (CODE THIS TIME!)
    
    Only nets and buses are rubberbanded, so there is no point adding other
    connected items (such as pins) into the stretch list.
    
    This fixes a bug where pins attached to nets being moved disappear if
    the user pans whilst moving. (The objects in the stretch list are marked
    "don't redraw" when starting a move operation.)
    
    To avoid nesting (yet another) huge "if" clause in the length of the loop
    in o_move_check_endpoint(), the loop has been re-written as a "for" loop
    to ensure its iterator is incremented when the loop is "continue"'d.
    The various nested : if (test) {...}          // wrapping the loop's core
    are now:             if (!test) continue;

    Rendering of the underlying line-segments would just be stopped anyway

    Split memory allocation for OBJECTs out of s_basic_init_object(). Add a

    Altered point selection mechanism to use distance instead of just a bounding box.
    
    This patch improves the mechanism used to select objects when using a single
    point.  In addition to using the bounding box, this patch calculates the
    distance between the selection point and the object itself.  This calculated
    distance provides a more accurate means to determine the actual object the user
    selected.

    Fix for dialogs drifting downwards on Cygwin/X.
    
    On Cygwin/X, reopening a gschem dialog restores its original position,
    but with a small vertical offset.
    
    The workaround is to show the dialog before restoring its position.
    
    The docs for gtk_window_move() offer a possible justification:
      "Most window managers ignore requests for initial window positions
      (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) and honor requests
      after the window has already been shown."
    
    The downside is, if you have a slow system, you could see the dialog
    appear briefly at the old position, I suppose.

    gschem: Combine code for operations which handle placement of OBJECTs.
    
    Replaces duplicated code related to component / text placement, copying /
    multi-copying objects and pasting from buffers with a common set of
    routines in the new file, gschem/src/o_place.c
    
    This refactoring lays the foundation to allow rotatation / mirroring whilst
    performing any kind of place action, without extensive duplicate code.
    
    All of the above operations now use a new PAGE variable, "place_list",
    rather than previous specialised variants complex_place_list, and
    attrib_place_list. Paste-buffer contents are copied into the place list,
    rather than placing directly from the paste-buffer, ensuring that any
    rotation / mirroring of the place-buffer does not change the paste-buffer.
    
    Helper functions, o_text_prepare_place() and o_complex_prepare_place() are
    added to load the place list with appropriate text, or a symbol. These are
    passed as arguments to the respective functions, avoiding the use of state
    stored in toplevel->current_attribute and toplevel->internal_symbol_name.

    Don't drop artifacts when redrawing in the middle of a move operation
    
    The nets being rubberbanded should not be redrawn in their original
    positions, so we set the "dont_redraw" flag on the rubberband objects
    to ensure they are not drawn (in their un-stretched position) during
    screen updates. We unset the flag in o_move_end() and o_move_cancel().

    gschem: Move freeing stretch list of to after move operation is ended
    
    Previously, the stretch list was left stale with pointers after a move
    operation, and only cleared when commencing a new move. By clearing it
    after each move operation (completed, or cancelled), we can ensure its
    contents are always valid.
    
    This is important so that at the end / cancellation of a move operation,
    we can operate on the stretch list without danger it was not up-to-date.
    If a move operation is started with rubberbanding disabled, and the user
    subsequently activates rubberbanding (during the move) with a key-stroke,
    stale pointers in the stretch list may have been dereferenced in error.

    Change default zoom-gain to from 50%, to 20% increase in size.
    
    Zooming in a smaller amount gives a greater degree of control when
    navigating around the schematic, with a (subjective) improvement to
    usability.

    Make size of panning steps with the mouse scroll wheel adjustable
    
    The new gschemrc function, (scrollpan-steps integer) controls how many
    scroll wheel events are required to pan across the viewed area of the
    schematic.
    
    The default setting keeps gschem's previous hard-coded behaviour of 4
    scroll events (in a particular direction) across the viewed area.

    Make the "gain" of zoom in / out operations an adjustable parameter.
    
    The new gschemrc function, (zoom-gain integer) controls the percentage
    size increase when zooming into the page. Zooming out uses the inverse
    factor such that a zoom in followed by a zoom out will return the
    schematic to the same size.
    
    E.g:
       20% increment => x 1.2 original size when zooming in
                     => x 1 / 1.2 x original size when zooming out
    
    The default gain keeps gschem's previous hard-coded behaviour of zooming in
    by a factor of 1.5. This is now specified with the command (zoom-gain 50).

    gschem: Activating component selector rows expands / contracts groups
    
    Observation of a user working with gschem showed that opening the groups
    of components from varous libraries was not particularly discoverable to
    a user not familiar with GTK. The user was noticed to be double-clicking
    the library sub-groups, rather than identifying the expander arrow.
    
    Fix this usibility issue by making double click, and other row-activation
    methods expand / contract the library groups. Keyboard navigation
    (where space / return activate given rows) is also easier now.

    Reinstated the 'object' property for multi attrib widget in place of
    the 'selection' one: the widget does not have to mess with selections,
    it is only interested in objects. Moved the selection watch stuff
    outside.

    gschem: use pointer from drawing area in preview and x_attribedit
    
    The preview widget used in the file dialog and in the component dialog is
    now using the pointer from the drawing area, too. The motion event function that tracked the pointer is no longer required.
    
    The attribedit dialog used the mouse_wx/y variables to set the attribute
    postion when activated with the hotkey. This usage has been removed.
    
    Removed all mouse_wx/y occurences in x_event and in the global.h file.
    This variables are completly gone now.

    used), or is drawing new objects, in which case the current action
    feedback mode is used.

    balancing snapped and unsnapped x/y coordinates
    
    All object actions need snapped coords, while selecting and zooming/panning
    need unsnapped coords.
    Unsnapped actions are now select, select-box, zoom-box and grips actions.
    grips motion is slightly special for arcs. While the radius is snapped
    the manipulation of start and endangle needs to remain unsnapped.
    All other grid motion actions (line, box, ...) still needs snapped coords.

    Those variables are obsolete and have been removed from the
    GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL structure.
    The panning also affected the preview widget. Which needed to be fixed, too.

    and not to overwrite them.  This functionality was originally written
    by "ar" and posted to the geda-dev mailing list.

    o_net.c the object iterator code has been changed to use the new library
    function.

    Zooming and paning redraw everything and if there are rubbernets
    they get deleted, too. We have to tell the rubbernet function that
    the rubbernet is no longer on the screen.
    Thus I've added a flag rubbernet_visible as indicator. This flag needs
    to be set when drawing, and reset when the rubbernet gets erased.

    Rename translations to drop un-needed ISO-3166 country codes.
    
    From Debian bug #336796:
    
    Using a country part in a translation file is a discouraged practice
    except in very few cases (such as pt_BR).
    
    Using a fr_FR.po file instead of a fr.po file prevents users of fr_CA,

    update the pinnumbers if a slot attribute is deleted
    
    Update the slots whenever a text line that is attached to an object
    gets deleted. The update checks the slotting even if there's no slot
    attribut. This catches the case when the user deletes a slot attribute
    and the current displayed pinnumbers are not the ones defined in the
    symbol. This commit fixes [#1880221]

    Fix a crash when running a script that calls (gschem-image ...)
    
    x_image_lowlevel frees the last parameter (filetype).  This free was
    causing a segfault when x_image_lowlevel was being passed a constant
    character string.  Bernd Jendrissek found this bug during an irc
    discussion.  Thanks.

    Only call gdk_window_invalidate_rect() when drawing to a GdkWindow.
    
    For image export, a GdkPixmap is used in place of w_current->window,
    and calling gdk_window_invalidate_rect() with this as an argument
    causes lots of nasty warnings. It led to a crash when print.scm is
    used to export from the command line.
    
    This "fix" is really quite a nasty hack. Since w_current->window is
    a GObject in both cases, a test with GDK_IS_WINDOW() can be used to
    distinguish the cases. A better fix will come from future rework of
    the drawing code.

    Previously, "u" was add-bus-hotkey, which was annoying a growing number of
    users.  Now "u" is undo and "Shift-B" is add-bus.  There are now like four
    different keys for undo (u, Shift-U, Control-Z, and "e Shift-U") in the
    default keymap.  Add/bus has "Shift-B" and "au" as hotkeys.

    Invalidate component cache when updating symbols. [#1880211]
    
    Temporary fix for Bug #1880211, "symbol update reads the symbol from
    the cache". Ensure that when refreshing symbols, the symbol is read
    from the component source, not from the cache. (Suggested by Peter
    Brett).
    
    A more complete fix will be to add API which invalidates a single symbol
    name, rather than the entire cache.

    This addition will do a full redraw as well (not sure if that is going
    to cause problems at this point).

    Remove "Apply" button from the component selector.
    
    As the component list is de-selected when placement mode is cancelled,
    the action of re-selecting a component to place switches back to this
    mode without the need for an explit "Apply" button.

    De-select list in the compselect dialog when placement is cancelled.
    
    By de-selecting the list, we ensure that the list state reflects the
    component the user may currently place. It allows the same component
    to be selected for again, without either using the "Apply" button,
    or having to temporarily select a different component first.
    
    As a hook to de-select the list is added in o_redraw_cleanstates(), we
    now avoid using that call as a shortcut to cleanup our last place
    operation. It is still used if the last operation was not a component
    placement.

    This commit adds a autoconf friendly m4 macro to check for undefined
    macros (originally written by Peter Brett).  This macro is used in
    configure.ac.in to check for a few troublesome macros (guile, nls,
    gettext, intltool) that are usually missing because a required -dev
    package is not installed/missing.

    Change image embedding format to base64 encode the original files
    
    Previously, the format was a base64 encoding of serialised output from
    the gdk_pixbuf used to store the image internally. Due to another bug
    (now fixed) it is known that no official gEDA release could re-load
    the embedded images that it saved. This hopefully provides some
    justification as to why its OK to change the embedding format here.

    gschem: Don't lose close confirmation dialog behind window
    
    It was possible to lose gschem's close confirmation dialog behind the
    gschem main window, which could lead to data loss as it was then very
    difficult to recover gracefully.

    Switch back to the page we were on after a saving changed pages.
    
    The changed page saving code switches pages with s_page_goto(), but the
    page was not switched back. This lead to gschem being left editing a
    different page after a cancelled close operation. No redraw or GUI
    update was called, so the screen still showed the old page.

    Fix bug #1851403: Crash after adding component while in move mode
    
    Ensure any operation already in progress when opening the component
    selector is cancelled by calling o_redraw_cleanstates() first.
    
    Also call o_redraw_cleanstates() just before placing the component,
    rather then directly freeing the objects in the complex place list.
    Since the component selector isn't modal, the user may have switched
    to a different action whilst the component selector was open.
    
    To avoid a similar crash, use o_redraw_cleanstates() upon closing the
    component selector (if we are still in component placement mode).

    The previous redraw scheme which would draw to the screen concurrently
    with drawing to the backbuffer is proving to be a bottle-neck to recent
    desktops using compositing. Every draw we make forces the X server to
    compute a damaged region and re-composite the window.
    
    We now draw only into the backbuffer, and then invalidate the extents of
    the region we've drawn.

    This test isn't hit unless o_grips_motion() is called before the
    object_changing variable is set, and this would indicate a bug in
    libgeda or its client. This could currently cause a segfault if it
    were to happen, as the variable isn't initialised to NULL.
    
    Initialise object_changing to NULL, so any bug will always be caught.
    
    Tidy up indentation levels in o_grips_start() by returning early if we
    don't have any object to manipulate, rather than wrapping most of the
    funciton in an if (...) {...} test.

    Currently, gschem attempts to load "untitled-1.sch" from the cwd at

    behaviour for "untitled-N.sch", N>1).
    
    This has the side effect of stopping gschem from trying to load backup

    Update the all drawing state SCREEN co-ordinates when zooming / panning.
    
    By updating all of the co-ordinate state when zooming / panning, a redraw
    which includes a draw of any rubberbanded items will show them in the
    correct location. This allows XOR drawing to continue without dropping
    artifacts, or flashing up a "ghost" where the original element being moved
    was. The explicit erase for the gost item when moving is no longer needed.

    Simplifies both o_drawbounding(), and many functions which call it. No
    special casing outside o_drawbounding() is needed for OUTLINE vs.
    BOUNDINGBOX mode. Duplicated code has been reduced by making more use of
    o_drawbounding() during copying / complex OBJECT placement.
    
    This commit fixes bugs in code paths which aren't normally exercised, as
    the BOUNDINGBOX drawing mode isn't used any more. The code could be
    simplified further by removing the BOUNDINGBOX mode if desired.

    Free gdk events obtained with gtk_event_get().
    
    gtk_event_put() copies an event given to it, so if we retrieve an event
    and re-push it into the event queue, we still need to free our copy.

    Remove full screen redraw calls the rubberbanding and ..._end() functions.
    
    These calls aren't hit, as they were conditional on the inside_action flag
    being 0, which should not be the case when these functions are called.
    
    Temporarily add g_assert() statments to verify inside_action != 0 to prove
    these changes are appropriate. Assertions should be removed after testing.

    Remove the o_redraw_all_fast() function, as its not any faster now.
    
    Historically, o_redraw_all_fast() may have been used for faster drawing
    in some cases, however the o_redraw_all() call is now equivelant, with
    the addition of redrawing any "place" trails should gschem be mid-action.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL has a TOPLEVEL *toplevel pointer as its first elelment,
    gschem uses this to call libgeda functions. (Almost) all gschem functions
    now take the GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL as their first argument.

    Remove the redundant toplevel variables current_{show,visible}.
    
    These variables were previously used for an interactive method of attrib
    placement which has since been removed. The current_visible variable was
    also tested during non-attribute text placement, but to no effect.
    
    Whilst the file-format does technically allow invisible text, gschem's UI
    pesesnts no way to achieve it, so removing this variable does no harm. The
    ability to correctly load schematics with invisible text remains.

    Fix memory corruption and possible segfault copying attributes
    
    If an object (but not all its attributes) was selected and copied, dangling
    pointers were left in the un-copied attributes. A subsequent copy operation
    containing those missed attributes would attempt to reattach them to the
    copy of their parent. If this had been deleted in the mean time, memory
    corruption and a possible segfault would occur.
    
    Consolidates the duplicated code which sets the ATTRIB property "copied_to"
    into a helper function, o_attrib_list_copied_to(). This is also used to
    clean up after copy operations.

    Fix for Bug# 1782032: Blank attibute name when attribute value starts with " "
    
    In order to fix this bug, we needed to validate the input attribute when:
    1) input an attribute using the single attribute editor,
    2) Add an attribute in the multi-attribute editor
    3) Modify the name or value of an attribute in the multi-attribute editor
    An attribute is not valid if the name or value are empty, name ends with a
    space, and/or value starts with a space.  o_attrib_get_name_value does
    this validation throughout gaf.

    Moved refresh button in component select dialog box
    
    The refresh button was along the very bottom of the component select
    dialog box at the same level as Close, Apply, and OK.  The refresh
    operation is not nearly as important or first class as these actions.
    The refresh button was moved to the filter area.  Whether this change
    sticks depends on what users think of the new location (I'm quite willing
    to move it elsewhere if there is a better spot).

    Added undo-panzoom keyword to control if pan/zoom cmds are undoable
    
    The default is to still store the pan/zoom info when panning or zooming,
    but now the user has a choice.

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Make updates faster when typing in the component selector filter.
    
    The filtering process doesn't happen until after the user pauses typing.
    Reducing the update delay from 300ms to 200ms makes this feel better.

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Sun Aug 12 01:56:58 2007 +0100

    Fix crash closing component selector window quickly after filtering.
    
    Typing in the filter box adds new update timeouts (300ms) with each
    keystroke. If typing fast there could be more than one timer active at
    once, however only the last added is cancelled when closing the dialog.
    Timers which ran after the dialog closed could cause a segfault.
    
    We now cancel any pending timeout before adding a new one.

    When trying to reach a specific parent we've come from before, we can use
    s_page_goto() and avoid the search through the page list.

    segment. Don't attempt to undraw the (zero length) rubberbanded line after
    the coordinates have been invalidated.

    Change color in the multi-attrib dialog "value" entry when insensitive.
    
    Makes the "value" GtkTextView look the same as its neighbouring widgets
    when insensitive. Unfortunately GtkTextView always appears to render using
    the style's GTK_STATE_NORMAL text color. We save that initial value, and
    copy across either the saved value, or the GTK_STATE_INSENSITIVE text color
    when setting the widget sensitivities.
    
    NB: This is just a workaround for what appears to be a bug in GTK+.

    Update the multi-attrib dialog after an undo operation.
    
    The undo mechanism replaces the page (and selection object), so we need to
    poke the multi-attrib dialog after an undo operation for it to watch the
    new page's selection object.

    Don't blank the add attribute boxes in the Multiattrib dialog.
    
    Leaving the text present after adding an attribute makes it is easier to
    add the same attribute to multiple objects. Instead we add a "grab-focus"
    signal handler to select the text box contents as we tab into it.

    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

    Alter panning code to center the page in the viewport if under-zoomed
    
    Centering is independant in the X and Y directions. When the viewport is
    larger than the page canvas in a particular direction the page is
    re-centered in that direction. This is necessary for a nice preview.
    Also change preview widget code to remove the A_PAN_IGNORE_BORDERS flag
    from zoom operations, which is no-longer needed with the above changes.

    Make the preview widget resizable
    
    Added handler for the configure event to resize the backing store and
    re-zoom the preview. Added the A_PAN_IGNORE_BORDERS flag to the zoom
    extents calls - giving a nice centered preview.
    
    Altered component selector dialog's alignment widget to allow the preview
    widget to expand to fill the available space.

    Fix mouse initiated zoom / panning operations on the preview widget
    
    The preview widget isn't called with a filename for previewing component
    sources, so the test for filename != NULL in the mouse event handlers
    stopped those callbacks working.
    
    Also added a scroll event handler to allow zooming with the mouse wheel.

    Fix zoom extents to work correctly first time. Closes bug #1699959.
    
    A page's visible area is intialised to be the same size as the canvas
    extents. The zoom extents code scales based on this visible area, however
    this initialisation isn't correct, since the aspect ratio of the screen
    doesn't always match the canvas extents. The first call to zoom extents
    would fix this by correctly setting the visible area.
    
    By making the zoom extents code work from the screen aspect ratio (scaled
    to world coordinates), we can zoom to the visible extents in one shot.
    
    Also fixed some /2 operations, which for doubles should be /2.0

    Save/restore geometry of the GtkHPaned in the component selection dialog.

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Sat Jul 21 19:16:24 2007 +0100

    Extend GschemDialog to allow hooking to save/restore internal geometry
    
    GschemDialog now emits "geometry-save" and "geometry-restore" signals
    which instances can connect to. Subclasses may over-ride and chain the
    "geometry_save" and "geometry_restore" class members. These signal handlers
    are passed a pointer to the GKeyFile and a text string identifying the
    group it expects data to be saved under.
    
    The code relies on features only available in GLIB 2.6 onwards. When using
    this functionality the code must be surrounded with an appropriate test as
    the class functions are not defined when compiling against an older GLIB.

    We need to perform various setup actions when the toplevel property of our

    the current method of just calling pagesel_update isn't correct for all
    future cases.

    Fixed memory leak placing components.
    
    When placing components we free'd the complex_place_list without removing
    the objects it pointed to. The code now uses s_delete_object_glist(..)
    rather than g_list_free(..) to free the complex_place list and its objects.

    Disable rotating while copying, & fix hitting rotate hotkey/menu while moving.
    
    Rotating while copying is still not supported, so disable it.
    Fix behaviour when hitting the rotate hotkey, or select the edit->rotate menu
    while moving.
    Previously the move action was cancelled and then the selection was rotated.
    Now, the objects being moved are rotated, and the move action continues.

    In the compselect window, focus can be set to the filter entry only
    if it is visible (i.e.: its ancestor is the current tab). Otherwise,
    GTK is confused.

    Fixed drawing bug when attribute autoplacing is enabled.
    
    When rotating while placing a new component, the refdes was drawn
    wrongly, and it was shown fixed in the screen despite the component
    being moved.
    This was due to attribute autoplacing function was called before drawing
    the component. This function erases the old text (which wasn't drawn), thus
    drawing the text in the screen permanently.
    This fix disables all drawing functions when calling autoplacing function,
    and renables them afterwards.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Implemented the ability to change the color of junctions (code for #1746675).
    
    The filled circles (at the junction of nets) and filled boxes (at the
    end of unconnected nets) were the same color and it was hard to tell the
    difference from a distance.  This patch addes (junction-color ...) rc
    keyword and allows the user to change the junction color.  The default
    color for the dark color scheme is yellow and the default color for the
    light color scheme is purple.

    gschem: Add "In Use" view to component selector.
    
    The "In Use" view shows symbols which are instantiated in open
    schematics, for ease of adding more symbols similar to the ones
    already present.  This is particularly useful for frequently-used
    symbols such as resistors and capacitors.

    gschem: Don't use generic response IDs for compselect actions.
    
    The component selector "OK" and "Apply" buttons aren't actually "OK"
    and "Apply" actions, so they shouldn't use those response IDs -- it's
    confusing.
    
    This patch adds special response IDs for these actions. This is a
    preparation for using "proper" Place and Hide icons & text.

    gschem: Fix a race condition with mouse wheel scroll events (1740327)
    
    If more than one mouse wheel scroll events are received into the event
    queue before the first one can be processed, then the program was
    zooming in to the wrong location.  This is because the mouse moved
    event handler, which is triggered by a call to warp the cursor in the
    scroll event handler, must run to update the mouse postion global
    variables that the scroll event handler needs.

    libgeda: Add fine-grained control over f_open() behaviour.
    
    Add a function f_open_flags() which takes an extra argument which is a
    set of flags controlling actions taking while opening a file. f_open()
    wraps this with a default set of flags.
    
    Coincidentally, this also leads to a trivial fix for the file open
    dialog backup-message bug.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Don't cache symbol pointers in persistent structures.
    
    Several persistent structures, including TOPLEVEL and OBJECT, cache
    pointers to CLibSymbols.  This is bad, because it makes removing
    component sources or rescanning them likely to cause stale pointers
    around the place.
    
    With fast hashtable-cached searches in place, this is no longer
    necessary.  This patch ensures that only symbol names are stored
    persistently.
    
    This patch also enables descending into embedded symbols using a
    component library lookup on the embedded symbol's name.

    Replace s_clib_glob() with s_clib_search(), which can operate in
    either exact matching or glob matching mode.  Use a hashtable to cache
    the results of library searches. The hashtable is cleared every time
    it is invalidated (for instance if a component source is added or
    removed, or the component sources are rescanned).

    Removed code handling escape key presses in dialogs.
    
    Since GTK takes care of escape key presses, this code
    is not needed. Applied patch from Ivan Stankovic.
    Fixes bug #1710818 for gschem. Thanks.

    Fix gschem's sort-component-library option
    
    In the last release, the sort-component-library gschemrc option did
    nothing.  This patch corrects the issue, by adding an argument to
    s_clib_get_sources which enables or disables sorting the list of
    component sources.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Added call to g_thread_init() in Gschem and Gattrib.
    
    Gschem and Gattrib aren't threaded, but some of GTK's file chooser
    backends uses threading so we need to call g_thread_init().

    Fixed a behavior where you would cancel (via right mouse button or escape)
    the placing of components, but gschem would still be in the add component
    mode (and clicks would still place components).

    Applied patch by Ivan Stankovic making dialogs within gschem save
    their position and size on exit and restore it on opening.
    Geometry is saved to {$HOME}/.gEDA/gschem-dialog-geometry
    
    Dialogs inherit this functionality by using, or deriving from the
    new GschemDialog class (A GtkDialog subclass).

    Implement new component library system in gschem.
    
    A new component library model was introduced into libgeda to
    allow gschem etc. to work well with database systems.  This
    patch updates gschem to use the new library system.  Most code
    dealing with creating, updating and (un)embedding symbols is
    affected.  However, this patch should not introduce any
    changes for the end-user.
