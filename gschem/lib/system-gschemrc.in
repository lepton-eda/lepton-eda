; Bus ripper controls
; The following keywords control the auto bus ripper addition code
;
; bus-ripper-size  : Sets the size of the auto bus rippers.  
; bus-ripper-type  : Sets the bus ripper type either a "component" or 
;                    plain "net"
; bus-ripper-syname  : If above is set to component, specify the symbol name.
;                      The symbol must exist in a component library
; bus-ripper-rotation  : Either "symmetric" or "non-symmetric".  This deals 
;                        with how the bus ripper symbol is rotated when it 
;                        is auto added to a schematic.

; Dots grid dot size
;
; The dots-grid-dot-size keyword controls the size of the grid dots in the
; dots grid display. The units are in pixels. The default (min) value of 1
; is the best performing as the grid dot size is rendered as a single pixel.
; Values of 2 and 3 are good values to try if the default grid dot size is
; too small for your tastes. Anything larger than 3 is probably too large.

; Dots grid mode
;
; The dots-grid-mode keyword controls the mode of the dotted grid, either

; control the density of the grid using the dots-grid-fixed-threshold.

; Dots grid fixed threshold
;
; The dots-grid-fixed-threshold specifies the minimum number of pixels
; grid-spacing for the grid to be displayed. Using this parameter you can
; control thedensity of the displayed grid (smaller numbers will cause the
; grid to be drawn denser). This mode is only used when grid-mode is fixed.
;
(dots-grid-fixed-threshold 10)

; Mesh grid display threshold
;
; The mesh-grid-display-threshold specifies the minimum line pitch for a the
; grid to be displayed. Using this parameter you can control maximum density
; of the displayed before the minor, then major grid-lines are switched off.
;
(mesh-grid-display-threshold 3)
