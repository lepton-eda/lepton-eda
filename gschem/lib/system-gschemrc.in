; This section defines associations between a stroke sequence and a 
; guile function which is executed when the stroke is drawn in the
; gschem window
;
; Strokes are defined as follows: 
;
; 1  2  3
;
; 4  5  6
;
; 7  8  9
;
; The sequence of number such as "852" specify how the stroke is drawn.
; Sequence "852" happens to be a vertical line drawn from the bottom going 
; up.
;
; Please see the libstroke documentation for further information on the 
; stroke description.  
;
; For the most part I went a little overboard on the stroke defs, you 
; probably can get away with many less stroke defs, but I'm a very 
; sloppy stroke drawing person. :-)  Guess my teachers were always 
; right-- my handwritting was/is awful.
;
; Be careful here, strokes is a rather large list, and make sure you maintain
; proper ( and )'s.
