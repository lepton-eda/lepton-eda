This directory contains the testsuite for the "gxyrs" script.
No modifications to this script are allowed without adding tests here.
If a bug report is filed, a test must be added to show the bug before
it is allowed to be fixed.

If you require additional input files, add them in the inputs/ directory.
Reference output files go in outputs/.  Add the test description to
tests.list.
