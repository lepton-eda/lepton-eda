# $Log$
# Revision 1.2  2005-12-21 00:09:56  danmc
# - Fix a bug where when using the --pgskip option, components which were
#   present on page n, but not on pages n+1 through n+j, and present again
#   on page n+j+1 got numbered in a strange way.  For example, J101 on page
#   1, no connectors on page 2, J201 on page 3 instead of J301.  Noted by
#   Stuart Brorson.
#
# - While here allow the user to change the default increment from 100 to whatever
#   they want.
#
# - Also fix a bug where exactly 101 components with the same refdes prefix
#   would cause a duplicate refdes on the next page.
