.SH NAME
.B pads_backannotate 
\- backannotates changes from a PADS engineering change order (ECO) file to schematic

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pads_backannoate \-h\||\-\-help

.B pads_backannoate \-V\||\-\-version

.B pads_backannoate
[options]
.I ecofile.eco infile1.sch [infile2.sch ...]  


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.I pads_backannotate
program reads an engineering change order (ECO) file generated by the PADS program
and backannotates the requested changes to a gschem schematic or schematics.
Refer to the PADS manual for a complete description of the ECO file format.  

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h, \-\-help
prints help message and exits
.TP
\-n, \-\-nocopy
Leave the modified schematic files in new files
whose names are generated by appending 
.I ".new"
to the
original file names.  The default is to overwrite the original.
.TP
\-V, \-\-verbose
operate verbosely
.TP
\-v, \-\-version
prints version information and exits

.SH EXIT STATUS
.I pads_backannotate
will return
.B 0
if all files processed successfully,
.B non-zero
if the command did not complete successfully.

.SH BUGS
Rather than parsing and processing schematic files directly, this utility should
be rewritten using the gEDA scheme API.  This would take advantage of the existing
parsers for the schematic files.

Reference designator renaming is fully supportd.  Pin and gate swapping is parsed
but not automatically applied to the schematic database.  Instead, a report listing
the manual pin and gate swapping that is required.  The other features of the ECO
file are not supported yet.
