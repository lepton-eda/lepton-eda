.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-schlas
can embed the in-use schematic symbols and pictures into a schematic
or set of schematics.
It allows, for instance, putting a schematic on a website or in an email 
without the recipient needing to download lots of custom symbols for the 
design.
.PP
.B lepton-schlas
can also unembed symbol references from a schematic, but note that the
symbols revert to library references; if the symbol doesn't exist in
the current Lepton EDA project's library path, a broken schematic results.
