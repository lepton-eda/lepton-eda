.SH NAME
.B pcb_backannotate
\- backannotates changes from a PCB annotation file to schematic

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcb_backannotate \-h\||\-\-help

.B pcb_backannotate \-V\||\-\-version

.B pcb_backannotate
[options]
.I ecofile.eco infile1.sch [infile2.sch ...]  


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.I pcb_backannotate
program reads an engineering change order (ECO) file generated by the PCB program
and backannotates the requested changes to a gschem schematic or schematics.
Refer to the PCB manual for a complete description of the ECO file format.  

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h, \-\-help
prints help message and exits
.TP
\-n, \-\-nocopy
Leave the modified schematic files in new files
whose names are generated by appending 
.I ".new"
to the
original file names.  The default is to overwrite the original.
.TP
\-v, \-\-verbose
operate verbosely
.TP
\-V, \-\-version
prints version information and exits

.SH EXIT STATUS
.I pcb_backannotate
will return
.B 0
if all files processed successfully,
.B non-zero
if the command did not complete successfully.

.SH BUGS
Rather than parsing and processing schematic files directly, this utility should
be rewritten using the gEDA scheme API.  This would take advantage of the existing
parsers for the schematic files.
