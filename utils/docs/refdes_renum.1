.SH SYNOPSIS
.B refdes_renum [\-\-nocopy] [\-\-pgskip [
.I number
.B ] ]
.I file1
.B ...
.PP
.B refdes_renum --help

.B refdes_renum --version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B refdes_renum
reads a gschem schematic file or files and renumbers all reference
designators.  The reference designators are numbered starting with 1 and the
old schematic file is replaced by the modified schematic file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-help
Display a help message.
.TP
\-\-nocopy
If given, this flag leaves the modified files in new files
whose names are generated by appending a `.renum' to the
original file names.  The default is to overwrite the original.
.TP
\-\-pgskip
When this flag is used, components on the first schematic sheet
are numbered starting with 101.  On the second sheet, they start
with 201, etc  Specifying a value gives the step between pages.
For example --pgskip 10 will start with 11, 21, 31, etc.
.TP
\-\-gentle
This flag tells refdes_renum to leave any refdeses
alone if they already have numbers.  Use this option to number
new components in a schematic which has already been numbered.
Note that --gentle is set by default!
.TP
\-\-force
Set this flag to renumber all refdeses, whether they are already
numbered or not.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Enables verbose output.
.TP
\-\-version
Shows the version of this program.

2
Error opening or writing output file.
.TP

4
Internal error (program bug encountered).
.SH EXAMPLES
To renumber the reference designators in a single page schematic mysch.sch:
.IP
refdes_renum mysch.sch
.PP
To renumber the reference designators in schematic pages pg1.sch, pg2.sch and
pg3.sch, with the reference designators on pg1.sch beginning at 101, the
designators on pg2.sch beginning at 201, and the designators on pg3.sch
beginning at 301:
.IP
refdes_renum \-\-pgskip pg1.sch pg2.sch pg3.sch
