;;; This program is used to create a Lepton EDA design archive.
;;; It operates in two modes: archive mode and extract mode.  In
;;; archive mode it creates a project archive from a bunch of
;;; project files, and in extract mode it extracts the files from
;;; the archive and places them in the local dir.

;;; Detailed description:

;;; Use -h option to get information about program invocation.

;;; Archive mode algorithm:
;;; - In the project directory (current directory), create archive
;;;   file list containing 'gafrc', files listed on command line,
;;;   and contents of the file specified with the --files-from (-f)
;;;   option.
;;; - Make temporary directory with the name of the project.
;;; - Make cache directory in it.
;;; - Create schematic file list from the archive file list.
;;; - Copy all schematics and files from the archive file list
;;;   into the temporary directory.
;;; - Copy symbols from all the schematics into the cache
;;;   directory.
;;; - Copy all SPICE files found in schematics into the cache
;;;   directory.
;;; - Fix gafrc in the temporary directory so lepton-schematic
;;;   could find all symbols and SPICE files in the archive later.
;;; - Create tar.gz archive from all the above files and move it
;;;   to the project directory.
;;; - Remove the temporary directory.

;;; Extract mode algorithm:
;;; - Copy archive file into temp directory.
;;; - Create a list of archive's contents using "tar -t -f
;;;   archive-name"
;;; - Extract files into the temp directory
;;; - Move all extracted files recursively into user's directory.
;;;   Before each move, make sure that no overwrite of existing
;;;   files will occur.

Used to create as well as extract Lepton EDA designs from an
archive.  The two modes of operation are \"archive mode\"
(archive creation) and \"extract mode\".  Archive mode is the default.

Command line switches:
  -h,--help             -- Print usage information.
  -V,--version          -- Print version information.
  -v,--verbose          -- Verbose mode.
  -f,--files-from=FILE  -- Additionally read filenames to archive
                           from FILE.
  -e,--extract          -- Extract mode. Mandatory if you want to
                           extract from archive.
  -a,--archive          -- Archive mode. It is the default mode.
  -o,--output=FILE      -- Specify the name of the output archive file
                           in archive mode.   If FILE has no \".tar.gz\"
                           suffix it will be automatically appended.
                           Default file name is \"~A.tar.gz\".

Example usage:
   Create an archive named \"MyArchive.tar.gz\",
   files to store are listed in \"archive-list\":

   lepton-archive -f archive-list -o MyArchive.tar.gz

   The same by using just file basename:

   lepton-archive -f archive-list -o MyArchive

   Verbosely create an archive from files listed on command line:

   lepton-archive -v README sch1.sch sch2.sch sch3.sch

   Extract an archive:
   lepton-archive -e ~A.tar.gz
