# The SCM_DEBUG_TYPING_STRICTNESS macro determines how C code that
# uses Guile Scheme values is compiled.  For CI builds, set it to 2
# (maximum strictness) to catch any possible problems, even though
# it'll result in low performance.
#
# We have to set SCM_DEBUG_TYPING_STRICTNESS to 0 for Coverity Scan
# builds, because with a non-zero value libguile's macros generate
# code that Coverity correctly identifies as undefined behaviour in C.
# However, we can't detect whether this is a Coverity build during the
# "install" step because the $COVERITY_SCAN_BRANCH variable isn't set
# until _after_ the Coverity static analysis step runs.
