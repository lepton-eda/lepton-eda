/*! \brief Evaluate a lepton-schematic action by name.
 * \par Function Description
 * Evaluates the action named \a action_name, which should be a UTF-8
 * string naming a symbol in the user module.  If evaluating the
 * action fails, prints a message to the log and returns FALSE;
 * otherwise, returns TRUE.
 *
 * \param w_current    Current lepton-schematic toplevel structure.
 * \param action_name  Name of action to evaluate.
 *
 * \return TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.

/*! \brief Get the action position.
 * \par Function Description
 * Retrieves the current action position and stores it in \a x and \a
 * y, optionally snapping it to the grid if \a snap is true.  This
 * should be interpreted as the position that the user was pointing
 * with the mouse pointer when the current action was invoked.  If
 * there is no valid world position for the current action, returns
 * FALSE without modifying the output variables.
 *
 * This should be used by actions implemented in C to figure out where
 * on the schematic the user wants them to apply the action.
 *
 * See also the (schematic action) Scheme module.
 *
 * \param snap         "Snap" returned coords to the grid.
 * \param x            Location to store x coordinate.
 * \param y            Location to store y coordinate.
 *
 * \return TRUE if current action position is set, FALSE otherwise.
