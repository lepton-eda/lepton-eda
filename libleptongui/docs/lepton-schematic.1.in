.SH NAME
lepton-schematic - Lepton EDA Schematic Capture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-schematic
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] [\fI--\fR] [\fIFILE\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B lepton-schematic
is a schematic capture application, and is part of the
Lepton EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolset.  It is used to draw
electronic schematics, which describe the logical structure of an
circuit. Schematics are made up of symbols, which represent the
various components in the circuit, and are obtained either from a
standard library or created by the user.  The connections between
components represented by nets (wires).  Schematics may be printed to
a PostScript file for printing or further conversion to other output
formats.  Output to various image formats is also supported.

.B lepton-schematic
can also be used for editing symbols for use in
schematics.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Quiet mode. Turn off all warnings/notes/messages.
.TP 8
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Verbose mode.  Output all diagnostic information.
.TP 8
\fB-L\fR \fIDIRECTORY\fR
Prepend \fIDIRECTORY\fR to the list of directories to be searched for
Scheme files.
.TP 8
\fB-s\fR \fIFILE\fR
Specify a Scheme script to be executed at startup.
.TP 8
\fB-c\fR \fIEXPR\fR, \fB--command\fR=\fIEXPR\fR
Specify a Scheme expression to be evaluated at startup.
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message.
.TP 8
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print \fBlepton-schematic\fR version information.
.TP 8
\fB--\fR
Treat all remaining arguments as schematic or symbol filenames.  Use
this if you have a schematic or symbol filename which begins with `-'.

.SH SCHEMATIC AND SYMBOL FILES
Optionally, schematic or symbol \fIFILE\fRs may be specified on the
command line.  Any schematic or symbols specified are loaded at
startup as separate documents in the schematic editor.
.PP
If no \fIFILE\fRs are specified, a blank schematic is created for
editing.
