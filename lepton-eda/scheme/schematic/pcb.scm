;; ** WARNING **
;; This file contains highly experimental code.  Use at your own risk.
;;
;; TODO
;;  Note:  This list is incomplete.
;;
;; - complete a project file which is essentially the same as a gsch2pcb
;;   project file.
;;
;; - figure out how we should specify gsch2pcb arguments.  The project file?
;;
;; - figure out how to launch a gsch2pcb editor to modify the gsch2pcb project
;;   file.
;;
;; - figure out how to capture standard output from gsch2pcb and put it to 
;;   the gschem log.  Perhaps a gschem-system-and-log function?
;;
;; - tell the listening pcb to load the new netlist and also load the
;;   new elements to the paste buffer after running gsch2pcb
;;
;; - when launching pcb, tell it to load the correct file or maybe after after
;;   running gsch2pcb, tell pcb what to load.
;;
;; - back annotate (once we implement it)
;;
;; - figure out how to have pcb talk back to gschem for selecting/deselecting
;;   elements.
;;
;; - figure out how to install the hotkeys
;;
