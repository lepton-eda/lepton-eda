    Bump fileformat verison to 2
    
    Since we've added path support, we need to bump the file-format
    version before any new release is made.

    symbols: Fix fill of emitter arrow in npn-1.sym
    
    Revert an acidental change which switched off filling of this arrow.

    libgeda: Emit each segment of paths on separate lines
    
    This allows greater redability of the path output, and simpler
    diffs when a single control point changes.
    
    Update the stock symbols which had paths emitted on a single line.
    Both read-back fine, but its best that we ship symbols in a state
    where a load / save cycle would not change the formatting.

    Rename "path" object identifier in the fileformat from "p" to "H"
    
    All other OBJECT type identifiers are upper case, and for consistency,
    now patHs are too.
    
    NB: No releases have been made since path support was added, so this
        change is still permissable.

    Add intltoolize to the build infrastructure

    symbols: Nicer names for default libraries
    
    Use the features added in the component library backend rewrite to
    give the default component libraries less cryptic names.
    
    Also, put them in a sensible order, and disable component library
    sorting by default so that that order is preserved.

    Alter system-gafrc to process .scm files in $GEDA_DATA_DIR/gafrc.d/
    
    This change allows each symbol package (e.g. geda-symbols) to install a
    scheme config file under this dir to load its contents. This allows
    additional symbol packages to be installed globally without needing to edit
    either geda-clib.scm or system-gafrc.
    
    Also moves the installation of geda-clib.scm into this directory.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Refactor system RC files
    
    Moved system-gafrc into the libgeda package, where it belongs.
    Removed all environment and configure substitutions.  Created separate
    font and component library setup scripts in the symbols package,
    automatically loaded by system-gafrc if they exist.  Updated
    system-gschemrc to use new infrastructure.
