; Start of attribute promotion keywords
; 

; attribute-promotion string
;
; This keyword controls if attribute promotion occurs when you instanciate a
; component.  Attribute promotion basically means that any floating attribute
; (unattached) which is inside a symbol gets "promoted" or attached to the 
; newly inserted component.  This only occurs when the component is 
; instanciated.
;
(attribute-promotion "enabled")
;(attribute-promotion "disabled")

; promote-invisible string
;
; If attribute-promotion is enabled, then this controls if invisible floating
; attributes are promoted (attached to the outside of the component) if the 
; text string is invisible.  There are cases where it is undesirable, so the 
; default is disabled.
;
;(promote-invisible "enabled")
(promote-invisible "disabled")

; keep-invisible string
;
; If both attribute-promotion and promote-invisible are enabled, then this 
; controls if invisible floating attributes are kept around in memory and
; NOT deleted.  Having this enabled will keeps component slotting working.
; If attribute-promotion and promote-invisible are enabled and this
; keyword is disabled, then component slotting will NOT work (and maybe 
; other functions which depend on hidden attributes, since those attributes
; are deleted from memory).
;
;(keep-invisible "disabled")
(keep-invisible "enabled")

; always-promote-attributes
;
; Set the list of attributes that are always promoted regardless of
; their visibility. The list should be a scm list of strings. The
; space separated attribute names are deprecated.

;(always-promote-attributes "footprint device value model-name")
