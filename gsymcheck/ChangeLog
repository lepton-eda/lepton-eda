	* include/pincounts.h, include/struct.h, include/prototype.h, 
	src/s_check.c, src/s_symstruct.c: Applied patch by Jim Duchek which
	adds several important tests to gsymcheck: 

		net=Vcc:8,15,14 (for example) is now checked against
		the pinnumber= attribs for duplicates.	footprint=
		is checked to get the proper pincount (I included some
		support for special cases like TO92, which doesn't
		quite have 92 pins :), and the number of pins defined
		vs. the number of pins that SHOULD be defined is compared.
		Total pins are found by: total = num_net_pins + (numslots
		* numpins).  Of course if numslots == 0 that multiplier
		doesn't happen.
	
	* tests/incorrect_footprint.sym duplicate_net.sym: Added a couple
	test symbols to exercise the above patch
