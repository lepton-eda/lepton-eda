    gsymcheck: moved obsolete and forbidden attribute checks
    
    This is a code cleanup patch, it moves the tests for obsolete and
    forbidden attributes to the symbol_structure test. Deleted the old
    check s_check_obsolete_forbidden_attributes() function and it's unused
    variables. In the output files, some format changes occured, but the
    meaning is still the same.

    gsymcheck: test for misplaced attributes
    
    The tests detect pin attributes are attached to nonpins or are
    detached. And attributes that are attached to any other objects.
    Attributes attached to pins that are not pin attributes

    added a check that contains all valid and five different case of
    invalid pintype values.
    Removed unused code in s_check_pintype() and added a function to
    check whether a string is in a list of strings.

Date:   Thu Jan 10 21:02:45 2008 -0500

    Removed misleading "pin count from footprint=" attribute check
    
    This check wasn't working correctly for all footprint= values.
    It probably worked fine for the DIP# and related footprints (ending
    with the number of pins in the footprin), but for others it was giving
    incorrect info/warnings.  This check will be replaced with something a
    little bit more flexible going forward in a later release.

Author: Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
Date:   Sat Jan 5 16:13:41 2008 +0100

    gsymcheck: added checks for offgrid pins
    
    The check prints an error message if the active end is offgrid and a
    warning message if the not active end is offgrid. The active end is
    detected with the whichend property.
    This fixes the feature request [#1565593]

    Fix configure checks for Guile (again).
    
    The previous patch missed changing the gschem configure script
    (generated from configure.ac.in), and got the logic wrong anyway.

    Add intltoolize to the build infrastructure
    
    Provide intltoolize infrastructure for translating .desktop and MIME
    XML files. Run gettextize after intltoolize if required, so that the
    infrastructure for providing libintl on a non GNU system still works.

    messages, they need to have all of the log info (including severity
    and log domain).

    Print useful messages when f_open() fails.
    
    This reinstates error messages removed by the patch which modified
    f_open() to use GError for error reporting.

    Make libgeda's f_open() & f_open_flags use GError.
    
    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.
