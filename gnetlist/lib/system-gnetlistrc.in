; net-naming-priority string
;
; Specifies which netname has priority if a net is found with two names.
; If this variable is set to "netattrib" then any netname specified with the

;
; Controls if uref names are mangled to make them uniq when traversing 
; down into the hierarchy.  If this is disabled then urefs are not changed
; and it is the user's responsibility to make sure they are unique.
; If you disable this, you really are taking your netlist's life into your
; own hands.  You *MUST* have unique urefs throughout the entire hierarchy
; or bad things might happen.  Also you cannot reuse underlying schematics.

; If you disable this, you really are taking your netlist's life into your
; own hands.  This basically has the effect of making all same named nets
; in the entire hierarchy be electrically connected.  Hope you know what you
; are doing.

; hierarchy-uref-separator string
;
; Specifies what the separator string between the various hierarchy tags
; for all urefs.  This string can also be "" (empty) to specify that no 
; chars should be used.  This keyword is ignored if hierarchy-uref-mangle 
; is disabled (though a default "/" is used in this case, and then all the
; internal mangling is removed so it is not seen by the user).  This keyword

; is ignored if hierarchy-netname-mangle is disabled.  This keyword
; is used in conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword.

; This keyword is also fairly coupled with hierarchy-uref-separator and

; the values: to get a portrait mode.  Code to support that needs to be added
; The code that implements this automatically transforms the dimensions into
