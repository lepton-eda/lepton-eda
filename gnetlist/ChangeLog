    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    gnetlist: Teach netlist traversal code to understand buses (still disabled)
    
    Up until recently, the connection scanning code has rejected some, but not
    all buses. This means that it is unlikely graphical buses formed a useful
    part of anyone's design, since the netlist code in s_traverse_net()
    would not follow connections to another bus segment. The only possible
    bus-pin connectivity has ever been "pin-bus-pin", or "pin-bus-net-...".
    
    This behaviour appears to have been accidental, and would not have been
    easy for a user to take advantage of. The traversal code would not move
    on to a subsequent bus, but would, for example, allow a pin->bus->!bus
    connection, which could then connect onwards. The bus mixed up in this
    would for all intents and purposes behave as a net.
    
    The pin->bus validity bug was actually fixed in libgeda when adding
    support for bus pins. This commit formalises it further, since if
    support for netlisting bus pins were enabled it would otherwise still
    be possible to get a buspin-bus-net-... connection if you tried hard.
    
    Introduce type-checking between pins, nets and buses such that they can
    not netlist where the object types don't match. For buses, the code to
    name a connection based on "netname", "net" or "label" attributes is
    disabled - pending decision as to what constructs we wish to use for
    naming buses. Add a gnetlistrc setting (unnamed-busname ...) which sets
    the default naming (if the connection scanning code were run on bus pins).
    
    This commit lays some of the ground work for shared connection scanning
    code for determining the connectivity of buses and bus pins.

    gnetlist: Disable traversal of bus pins when checking connectivity.
    
    We don't want graphical buses to be netlisted at present. Currently
    their output (although not correct connectivity in all but simple
    cases) can get muddled up with the normal netlist fed to backends.

    gnetlist: Refactor s_traverse_component() and s_traverse_net() slightly.
    
    Removes some duplicated code by not special-casing the first level of
    recursion when tracing out connections.
    
    The only outward change from this commit should be that nets / pins found
    immediately connected to a pin being inspected get their "n" or "P" print
    in the verbose debugging output. (One of the codepaths being consolidated
    didn't have them before). Unconneced pins no longer get a "p" print, since
    the traversal code isn't executed for them.

    gnetlist: Avoid depending on GHashTable ordering for output consistency
    
    If the GLib hash table changes (which it has in late versions of GLib),
    the netlist output ordering changes due to our mis-use of GHashTable to
    list all unique component names without enforcing any eplicit order on
    the enumeration of the hash table contents.
    
    Since ordering may be important to backends, want to have known output
    ordering whilst removing duplicate entrys, but without an explicit sort
    of the refdes list.
    
    This commit introduces an incremental build of the list, first checking
    the hash table for a hit, and only adding the new refdes if it wasn't
    already in the has table. This is gives the output a predictable order
    (based on the input), rather than inserting all refdes into the hash
    table, and building the list in whatever order the table implentation
    traverses them in.
    
    This change does unfortunately means a large number or ordering related
    changes are also made in the gnetlist test suite's golden files.
    
    There are also some non-ordering changes in the checked in golden files.
    These is encountered in the pretty well obsolete PCBboard backend - which
    errors out when it hits certain components it can't find footprints for.
    Changing the ordering changes the point at which it dies, and thus the
    netlist output. Lets just accept these changes as is.

    Quick fix for gnetlist exit status.
    
    In 2a4fdb13021d0153e788fe3b2fc005f273dcdf4b, gnetlist was modified to
    use g_scm_c_eval_string_protected() to call into
    backends. Unfortunately, this had the side effect of stopping Guile
    errors thrown by backends from causing gnetlist to exit with non-zero
    exit status.
    
    This is a quick fix which partially reverts the offending commit.

    gnetlist: Update common test-suite outputs for "systemc" backend
    
    Updated after fixing the backend to run again.
    
    NB: A cursory inspection of the "golden" files, suggests that the outputs
        being checked in are not actually correct. However, the test-suite
        will serve to tell us if any changes are made in gnetlist which affect
        this backend.

    gnetlist: Fixup systemc backend
    
    Don't escape < and > characters in strings, as guile doesn't like this.
    
    Apply similar fixes as those made to the VHDL and verilog backends after
    some changes in gnetlist to accomodate slotting in spice-sdb. Since the
    netlist backend is loaded before gnetlist has traversed the schematic, it
    must not execute any code which queries gnetlist on load. All such work
    is to be done only when gnetlist invokes the "systemc" method.
    
    Move (define c_p #f) to outside (systemc:components ...)'s (lambda ...)
    function, since guile doesn't appreciate us mixing declarations and
    expressions. This variable is tested and (set! c_p #t) later on, which
    doesn't feel very scheme like. The fix works for now though.
    
    Check to see if the regexp matched netname, checking for "name<type>" has
    hit a match before trying to get a piece of that match. If the regexp
    returns #f, instead just treat the identifier as a "name" and use that.
    This allows net names which don't conform to the regexp to at least give
    some vaguely sensible output, without crashing the backend.
    
    Comment some debugging prints to stdout, giving a cleaner looking run.

    Tolerated changes in golden files for the spice netlist backend.
    
    The way slotted parts are handled has changed since 1.2.0, as
    has the output of the spice backend for slotted parts. Since
    the spice backend doesn't properly support slotted components,
    we allow these output changes.

    awk that is good enough for the scripts that use them.  Now use this result
    in various scripts instead of hard coding 'gawk' (not available on all systems)
    or 'awk' (picks up the original awk which is not sufficiently advanced on solaris).
    
    Also avoid calling out /bin/bash on scripts for which /bin/sh (even on solaris) should
    be sufficient.  Not all systems have /bin/bash.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    is better.

    For now, wrap all calls to scm_c_eval_string() with mutable arguments
    in g_scm_c_eval_string_protected(), and since the latter function
    seems to behave when passed a NULL string this bug should just go
    away.

    Remove ineffective search inside symbol in vams_get_package_attributes()
    
    The call to vams_get_attribs_list (...->complex->prim_objs, ...) will
    always fail to return names. This function operates on the passed
    OBJECT, looking at OBJECT->attribs. In this case, the passed OBJECT
    will always be a complex head node with no attributes.
    
    We _might_ want to list the names of any floating attributes inside the
    object (as seems to have been intended in the original code), however
    all "interesting" generic attributes will probably have been promoted to
    the outside anyway. Promotable attributes inside symbols are only hidden
    by default (not deleted), so listing the internal attributes would mean
    we end up with two copies of each promotable attribute in our SCM list.
    
    There are also quite a number of uninteresting attributes inside most
    symbols which we may not want listing as generics. For now delete the
    broken code attempting to list internal attribute names.
    
    This commit doesn't change any netlist output.

    gnetlist: Don't drop all hierarchy prefix for children without refdes=...
    
    If a hierarchy block is missing its refdes=... attribute, insert it
    without any change of hierarchy prefix. The block's contents keep the
    same hierarchy level as the instantiating schematic. Previously the block
    was inserted at the root level, with no hierarchical name mangling.
    
    This may be useful in some cases if you want to suspend hiearchy mangling
    for certain portions of a hierarchical design. (NB: You would then be
    responsible for avoiding refdes name clashes). A similar effect can be be
    obtained on a design wide basis by setting the options:
    (hierarchy-*-mangle "disabled") in a gnetlistrc file.

    Tolerated changes in golden files for the vipec netlist backend.
    
    The way slotted parts are handled has changed since 1.2.0, as
    has the output of the vipec backend for slotted parts. Since
    this backend isn't likely to care about slotted parts, we allow
    these output changes as harmless.

    We want to track changes in netlist backend behaviour since version 1.2.0,
    as changes in slotted part handling since then have caused unintended
    differences in outputs for some backends. We can explicitly confirm
    thoses changes as desired or tolerable by checking in new golden files.

    The tests are applied to all backends, with control files being used to
    document the expected return codes, and golden files with the expected
    output. These files are generated from a 1.5.0 development release of
    of the gEDA suite, and do not in all cases represent "correct" behaviour,
    merely "gEDA 1.5.0" behaviour.

    The first-val-or-#f function should have been removed in commit
    406234a95a4a4a6ff65c60eb2d63e32c80623a2a when its use was optimised
    away.

    Make the pads netlist backend use CR/LF instead of just LF.
    
    Based on a discussion on the gEDA mailing lists it seems that PADS
    (which runs only on windows) needs DOS style netlists and not unix
    style netlists.  So rather than forcing a unix2dos step in beween
    netlisting and using the result, go ahead and teach the pads netlist
    backend to directly write out a DOS style netlist.  Update the
    testsuite accordingly.

    Fix verilog and VHDL netlist backends
    
    These were inadvertently broken when making core gnetlist changes to
    accomodate slotting in spice-sdb. Since the netlist backend is loaded
    before gnetlist has traversed the schematic, the backends must not
    execute any code which queries gnetlist on load. All such work is
    to be done only when gnetlist invokes the (<backend>) method.

    Revert "gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names"
    
    Stripping lower case refdes suffixes when netlisting for PCB (which
    ignores lowercase refdes suffixes) caused breakage when relying on
    matching a pinlabel=xxx to refdes=xxx inside a hierarchical
    schematic, where "xxx" had a lowercase suffix.
    
    This reverts commit e8b3be0fbcbf7518b05b437e13eeaa11478345aa.

    gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names
    
    Adds a custom (get-uref ...) function to the PCB, pcbpins and gsch2pcb
    back-ends. These strip lowercase suffixes from the uref, to ensure that
    slotted package names like IC1a and IC1b are treated as the same, IC1
    by gsch2pcb.
    
    This suffix stripping matches the fact that PCB ignores the lower-case
    suffix on net names. It would have been possible to leave the suffixes
    in the PCB and pcbpins output, although in the PCB netlist case, this
    causes any implicit power nets in each slot to be duplicated in the
    netlist, which PCB reports as an error.

    Fix spice-sdb slotting to work without modified pinseq attributes
    
    Removes all previous code which iterated over slots for a given package,
    replacing it with a custom (get-uref ...) procedure which ensures each
    slot of a component is given a unique uref when gnetlist traverses the
    schematic. This means each slot will appear as a separate "package" in
    the gnetlist data-structures, even if each slot uses the same refdes=
    attribute.
    
    The format for the package uref is "(refdes/uref).(slot)", in keeping
    with the existing spice-sdb slotting code.

    for interrogation.

    outputting angry control characters.  This was because a warning
    message used a string that had already been freed.

    gnetlist: Load gnetlist.scm and backend before schematic traversal.
    
    Allows gnetlist.scm and backends to define scheme procedures and
    variables which may be used to control the schematic traversal process.
    
    Since some portions of of gnetlist.scm are evaluated immediately upon
    load, yet require execution _after_  schematic traversal, these portions
    have been split out from gnetlist.scm into a new file, gnetlist-post.scm
    which is loaded after traversal.
    
    The moved definitions are those of "packages", "all-unique-nets",
    "all-nets", "all-pins", and the refdes aliasing functionality.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Fix for Bug#1776547: graphical versus source
    
    The usage described in Bug#1776547 is pretty unique, but it might be handy
    to support in general.  The recursive source= and graphical= behavior is
    a unexpected side effect of the traversal of graphical symbols/components
    (552e06e921e4b6eb758b9483d1913c39b3fef5f5).  The fix is to explicitly
    check for the graphical= attribute and if it is found to not further
    traverse the hierarchy.  Regression tests were added so this behavior
    doesn't change in the future.

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in

    Fixed two calls to free() where g_free() should have been used.
    
    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    guile-1.8.1 fixes and testsuite additions.
    
    Updated the cascade and pcbpins backends to work with guile-1.8.1.
    While here added a testsuite entry for these two backends.

    Portability fixes for the testsuite.
    
    Get the testsuite fully working on SunOS-5.9/sparc.  This
    entails two issues.  The "-I" option to diff is a GNU
    extension and is not supported by the solaris diff.  Work
    around this by using sed to filter out the lines which were
    to be ignored.  This addresses the tests run by gnetlist/tests/runtest.sh.
    
    The other issue is that the longopts tests in the spice-sdb
    testsuite should not be run on a system that does not have
    getopt_long().  To address this, extend the run_tests.sh to allow
    a variable in the tests.list file to disable a test unless set to "yes".

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    'make distcheck' can work again.  Now the this is fixed, re-enable

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
