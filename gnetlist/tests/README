Tests for gnetlist
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tests in this directory are basically just diffs against known good
output.  Fairly simplistic, but for now it's enough.  I have NOT verified
that the known good output is correct. 


	You must install gnetlist before you can run these tests.  You 
must also run the tests with all of the gEDA packages in ../..

To run the tests type:

	make tests

	The diffs should NOT generate any output.


Eventually the tests here will become a bit sophisticated.

If anybody has some sample schematics which can be netlisted, please (if you
can) submit them to me so I can put them into this test suite.
