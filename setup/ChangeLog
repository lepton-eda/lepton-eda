        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

	* src/setup.sh: Added the export keyword to the PATH and 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables to really make sure that the installed
	libraries are used instead of system libraries.

2003-12-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/install.c: Replaced with file provided by Piotr.  Fixes a 
	core dump.

	* src/setup.cfg: Replaced with file provided by Piotr.  Misc 
	correction to make make xinstall work correctly (forces the use
	of --with-gtk12).

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

	* src/setup.sh: Changed some test -x flags (for libraries) to -r
	since links to shared libraries are sometimes not executable.

        * m4/Makefile.am: Added some missing *.m4 files to EXTRA_DIST.

	* src/setup.sh, src/setup.cfg: Upgraded gtk+ 1.2.4 to 1.2.10.  This 
	was necessary since gschem has some problems working with 1.2.4.

	* src/setup.cfg: Fixed libstroke's filename to be ftp://... so that
	it is downloaded/built/installed if it isn't already installed.

	* src/setup.cfg: Fixed some incorrect descriptions (mainly for Glib).

        * src/package.c: Fixed bug: testing if file exists have been done
        using URL, not only the name of file (in case when full ftp path is
        configured).
        
2003-12-02 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>
