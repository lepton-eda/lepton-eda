"Version 2, June 1991\n"
"\n"
"Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n"
"59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA\n"
"\n"
"TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
"\n"
"0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice "
"placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms "
"of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such "
"program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the "
"Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work "
"containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with "
"modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, "
"translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) "
"Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
"\n"
"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered "
"by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program "
"is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its "
"contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been "
"made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the "
"Program does.\n"
"\n"
"1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code "
"as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and "
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and "
"disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this "
"License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of "
"the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n"
"\n"
"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you "
"may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
"\n"
"2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, "
"thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such "
"modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you "
"also meet all of these conditions:\n"
"\n"
"    * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices "
"stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
"\n"
"    * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in "
"whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part "
"thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under "
"the terms of this License.\n"
"\n"
"    * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when "
"run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the "
"most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an "
"appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or "
"else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute "
"the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy "
"of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does "
"not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is "
"not required to print an announcement.)\n"
"\n"
"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable "
"sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be "
"reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then "
"this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you "
"distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections "
"as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of "
"the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other "
"licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part "
"regardless of who wrote it.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your "
"rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise "
"the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works "
"based on the Program.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with "
"the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage "
"or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this "
"License.\n"
"\n"
"3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under "
"Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 "
"and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
"\n"
"    * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable "
"source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 "
"above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n"
"\n"
"    * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, "
"to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically "
"performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the "
"corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 "
"and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n"
"\n"
"    * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to "
"distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for "
"noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object "
"code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b "
"above.)\n"
"\n"
"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making "
"modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all "
"the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface "
"definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and "
"installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source "
"code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in "
"either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, "
"and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that "
"component itself accompanies the executable.\n"
"\n"
"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to "
"copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the "
"source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, "
"even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with "
"the object code.\n"
"\n"
"4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as "
"expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, "
"modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically "
"terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received "
"copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses "
"terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n"
"\n"
"5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed "
"it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the "
"Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you "
"do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the "
"Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of "
"this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, "
"distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n"
"\n"
"6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the "
"Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original "
"licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms "
"and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the "
"recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible "
"for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n"
"\n"
"7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent "
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), "
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or "
"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not "
"excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so "
"as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any "
"other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute "
"the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies "
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both "
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the "
"Program.\n"
"\n"
"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any "
"particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and "
"the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents "
"or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; "
"this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free "
"software distribution system, which is implemented by public license "
"practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of "
"software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent "
"application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or "
"she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a "
"licensee cannot impose that choice.\n"
"\n"
"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a "
"consequence of the rest of this License.\n"
"\n"
"8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain "
"countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original "
"copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an "
"explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so "
"that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. "
"In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the "
"body of this License.\n"
"\n"
"9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of "
"the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be "
"similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to "
"address new problems or concerns.\n"
"\n"
"Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program "
"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any "
"later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions "
"either of that version or of any later version published by the Free "
"Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of "
"this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software "
"Foundation.\n"
"\n"
"10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs "
"whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for "
"permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software "
"Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make "
"exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of "
"preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of "
"promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
"\n"
"NO WARRANTY\n"
"\n"
"11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR "
"THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN "
"OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES "
"PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED "
"OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF "
"MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO "
"THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM "
"PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR "
"CORRECTION.\n"
"\n"
"12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING "
"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR "
"REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, "
"INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING "
"OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO "
"LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR "
"THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER "
"PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE "
"POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"
