How to submit patches
=====================

Please submit patches to the patch tracker on SourceForge.net:

  <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161080&atid=818428>

Once you've submitted your patches, you may wish to also e-mail the
`gEDA-user' mailing list [1] to announce that you've done so and to ask
for feedback.

To make it easier for developers to promptly verify your patches and
integrate them, please try to follow the following guidelines:

  - If your patch is big, try to split it up into a series of small,
    logical steps, and use a separate patch for each.

  - Avoid unnecessary whitespace changes. Please do not add trailing
    whitespace.  If you must make bulk whitespace changes
    (e.g. because a file or function is formatted in a way that is
    *offensively ugly*) then please do so as a separate patch.

  - Ensure that each of your patches applies cleanly against the
    `master' branch of the gaf main git repository.

  - Please format your patches with `git format-patch' [2], and ensure
    that they contain good commit messages.  The commit messages
    should include:

      * A one-line summary of what the patch changes.

      * A detailed explanation of what the patch changes, the problem
        it solves, and why you chose that approach to solving the
        problem.  Sometimes, the change will be very self-explanatory.
        Sometimes, the commit message will be considerably longer than
        the patch itself.

      * If the patch is related to another ticket in the
        SourceForge.net tracker (i.e. a bug or feature request),
        include its tracker item number.

      * If your patch fixes a regression, and you know which commit
        introduced the regression, include the broken commit's ID.

    If you don't use `git format-patch' to create your patch, please
    include the commands needed to apply it when you submit it.
    Assume the reader's current working directory is the top level of
    the gEDA/gaf source tree.

  - Make sure it's clear whether, and in what ways, you've tested your
    patch.

  - If you add functions, or change function definitions, make sure
    that the doxygen [3] comments are up-to-date.

Sometimes, you may submit a patch and not hear anything back for a
while.  This can be for a number of reasons, and it's only very rarely
that there's a great conspiracy of gEDA developers to obstruct your
changes from getting included.  It might even be that your patch has
been committed, but the developer who did so forgot to let you know!
If it's been more than a couple of weeks since you submitted a patch,
you should e-mail the `gEDA-user' mailing list with a reminder.

A final thought: to get your patches included, make it easy to accept
them!

C coding style
==============

gEDA C coding style is fairly flexible.  However, there are a few requests.

  - Indent using spaces only, with an indentation step of two spaces.

  - Avoid C++ style comments (`//').

  - `switch' statements should always include a `default' label.

  - Do not comment out code or omit it using `#if 0', unless
    absolutely necessary for documentation purposes.  If code is not
    needed, delete it.

  - Wrap code at 80 columns.

  - Wrap the body of an `if' statement in braces `{}', even if the
    body only contains one statement.

  - When checking a pointer for validity, explicitly compare it with
    `NULL'.

       if (ptr == NULL) { return; } /* Good */
       if (!ptr) { return; }        /* Bad */

Obviously, all these rules are made to be broken, and it'll be obvious
when it's appropriate to do so. ;-)

Here is a set of options to GNU `indent' which approximates the gEDA
indentation style:

  -br -blf -bls -cdw -ce -cs -ts2 -sc -nut -bap -pcs -psl -lp l80 -bbo

Scheme coding style
===================

gEDA Scheme coding style is also fairly flexible.  Once again, though,
there are a few things to bear in mind!

  - When you need to iterate over a list, it's often better to use
    `map', `for-each' or SRFI-1 `fold' than to make your function
    recursive [1][2].

  - Predicate functions should have names ending in `?', and
    destructive functions should have names ending in `!'.

  - When defining a function, please use the "implicit define" form of
    `define' [3]:

    (define (<name> <formals>) <body>)

  - It's often clearer to use `format' to format strings rather than
    using a combination of `string-append', `display' and `newline'.
    This function is always available in Guile 1.8.x [4].
