Lepton EDA suite is a set of tools that provide schematic capture,
netlisting and export of schematics into several formats, which, in
turn, allows simulation via third party tools and producing PCBs.

The project is over twenty years old, and has matured to the point
where our design tools are suitable for use by students,
professionals, educators, hobbyists, consultants, and anybody who
needs a set of quality EDA tools.

The following contributed tools are not covered in this manual.
Mostly, those are for working with proprietary, often obsolete,
programs, so they are of limited use for most users.  Please see
corresponding man pages for more information.

@itemize
@item
convert_sym---convert a Viewlogic symbol/schematic to @ref{gEDA file
format}.
@item
gmk_sym---create rectangular symbols in @ref{gEDA file format} from a
text file.
@item
olib---OrCAD(tm) library part to gEDA .sym converter.
@item
sarlacc_schem---convert OrCAD SDT IV files to @ref{gEDA file format}.
@item
smash_megafile---break a Viewlogic megafile into a million little
pieces.
@item
gnet_hier_verilog.sh---generate a non-flattened hierarchical Verilog
netlist.
@item
pads_backannotate---process PADS PowerPCB .eco files to backannotate
changes to schematics in @ref{gEDA file format}.
@item
sw2asc---converts a SWITCAP2 output file into ASCII data files that
other tools can read.  @xref{Switcap backend} for more information.
@item
sch2eaglepos.sh---read a schematic in @ref{gEDA file format} and
attempt to extract the relative positions of the components in order
to generate corresponding MOVE instructions for Eagle.
@item
sarlacc_sym---convert OrCAD text libraries to components in @ref{gEDA file
format}.

@section Compatibility with geda-gaf
@cindex compatibility with geda-gaf

Lepton EDA is backward compatible with its predecessor @emph{geda-gaf}
and supports the same @ref{gEDA file format} for symbols and
schematics.  We are planning to support it in future since there are
lots of symbols and schematics created using it.  We cannot promise
you to support any change in @emph{geda-gaf} in future.  It's up to
you, our users, to point out what feature you would like to have in
Lepton.
