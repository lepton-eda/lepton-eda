@chapter Installation

Installation of Lepton is pretty simple on many operating systems and
distributions supporting pre-built binary packages.  Just use your
favorite package manager to install the package.  For example, on
Debian or Ubuntu, you could use @command{synaptic}, @command{apt-get},
or @command{aptitude} for installation.  It doesn't matter which
interface you use, GUI or CLI. For instance:
@example
sudo aptitude install lepton-eda
@end example

However, in some cases or on some systems you may want to install
Lepton from source code.  The order is as follows.
@itemize
@item
Download the source code:
@item
Compile it and install:
@example
cd the-directory-with-lepton-eda
autoreconf -ivf && ./configure && make && sudo make install
@end example
Call for @command{autoreconf} is not needed if you download sources as
a tarball of some version.
@item
In some cases, when, for example, a new library is installed, you may
need to launch @command{ldconfig} as well:
@example
sudo ldconfig
@end example
@end itemize

@section Dependencies

In order to compile Lepton from the distributed source archives, you
@strong{must} have the following tools and libraries installed:
@itemize
@item
A C/C++ compiler and standard library (@command{gcc}/@command{glibc}
are recommended, though you may use @command{clang} instead).
@item
@url{http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org, The pkg-config tool} for
managing shared libraries.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile, Guile} ("GNU's Ubiquitous
Intelligent Language for Extensions"), version 2.0.13 or later.
@item
@url{http://www.gtk.org, GTK+} (the Gimp Toolkit), version 2.24.0 or
later.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext, GNU gettext}, version 0.18
or newer.
@item
@url{http://flex.sourceforge.net, The lex tool} for generating lexical
scanners.  The @command{flex} implementation is recommended.
@item
The @command{awk} tool for data processing.
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk, GNU Awk} (@command{gawk}) is
recommended.
@end itemize

The following tools and libraries are @emph{highly recommended}:
@itemize
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/groff, GNU troff} (@command{groff}).
@item
@url{http://freedesktop.org/Software/shared-mime-info, The
freedesktop.org MIME info database}.
@item
@url{http://www.freedesktop.org/software/desktop-file-utils, The
freedesktop.org utilities} for manipulating @file{.desktop} files.
@end itemize

The following tools and libraries are optional:

@itemize
@item
@url{http://www.etla.net/libstroke, libstroke} a stroke and gesture
recognition library.  If this is available, @command{lepton-schematic}
will support mouse gesture recognition.
@end itemize

@node Troubleshooting dependencies, Installation from source, Dependencies, Installation
@section Troubleshooting dependencies

Sometimes, @code{./configure} says it cannot find a library while
the library is installed.  Really, it may just not find its headers
which live in a separate package.  Many modern operating system
distributions split a library into two packages:

@enumerate
@item
A package with binary files, say a @file{libfoo} package, which
contains the files necessary to @emph{run} programs which use
@file{libfoo}.
@item
A @dfn{development package}, @file{libfoo-dev} or @file{libfoo-devel},
which contains the files necessary to @emph{compile} programs which
use @file{libfoo}.
@end enumerate

If you're having problems, make sure that you have all of the
necessary development packages installed.


@node Installation from source, Installation from git, Troubleshooting dependencies, Installation
@section Installation from a source archive

First extract the archive to a sensible place:
@example
tar -xzvf lepton-eda-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz &&
cd lepton-eda-@value{VERSION}
@end example

Run the configuration script.  You'll probably want to specify a
custom directory to install Lepton EDA to, for example:
@example
./configure --prefix=$HOME/lepton
@end example

You can then compile Lepton:
@example
make
@end example

And install it (if you used a @option{--prefix} outside your
@env{$HOME} directory, you may need to run this as @emph{root}):

@example
make install
@end example

@node Installation from git, Configure options, Installation from source, Installation
@section Installation from the git repository

Lepton uses the @command{git} version control system.  If you wish to
try out the very latest version of Lepton, you will need to install
some extra tools @emph{in addition to} the ones listed above:

@itemize
@item
The @url{http://git-scm.com, git version control tool}, version 1.6 or
newer.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake, GNU Automake}, version
1.11.0 or newer.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf, GNU Autoconf}, version 2.60
or newer.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool, GNU Libtool}.
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo, GNU Texinfo documentation
system}.

Note that on some distributions the @TeX{} support for Texinfo is
packaged separately.
@end itemize

Once you have these installed, you need to clone the Lepton git
repository:

@example
git clone https://github.com/lepton-eda/lepton-eda.git
@end example

To generate the configure script, run:

@example
autoreconf -ivf
@end example

You can then proceed to configure and build Lepton as described above.

@node Configure options,  , Installation from git, Installation
@section Configure options
@cindex configure options
@cindex --with-gtk3
@cindex --disable-attrib
@cindex --enable-contrib

The following command in the build directory

@example
./configure --help
@end example

will let you see all options available.  Here we'll notice only those
of them that may be of special interest for the user.

@table @option
@item --with-gtk3
turns on support for GTK3 library. @xref{Installation of
lepton-attrib} for more information on what additional libraries are
needed to install @attrib.

@item --disable-attrib
turns off building and installing @attrib.

@item --enable-contrib
Build and installation of several contributed tools are disabled by
default.  @xref{Overview} for info on what tools can be additionally
installed.
@end table
