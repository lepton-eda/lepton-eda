@cindex Lepton command line utility

@cli{} provides a number of small command-line utilities for
working with Lepton schematic and symbol files, and is designed to be
used for batch processing of designs created using the schematic
editor @ref{lepton-schematic}.

General usage is:

@example
lepton-cli [OPTION...] COMMAND [ARGS ...]
@end example

Currently, @var{COMMAND} can be one of @code{config}, @code{export},
or @code{shell}.

Here is the description of @cli's general options:

@table @option
@item --no-rcfiles
Prevent @ref{gafrc} Scheme initialisation files from being loaded.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Print a help message.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Print @cli{} version information.

@end table

When @var{COMMAND} is specified, the tool launches specific utilities
really doing the job: @command{lepton-export},
@command{lepton-config}, or @command{lepton-shell}.  Any of them can
be used as standalone tools.

@menu
* lepton-cli export:: Export images from schematic and symbol files.
* lepton-cli config:: Configure all Lepton tools.
* lepton-cli shell:: Scheme REPL for interactively processing schematics.
@end menu
