This file documents important user-visible changes in Lepton EDA.  For
more information, please consult the `ChangeLog' file.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.9.2
=================================

* Build system changes:

  - Guile 2.0 or newer is now required.

  - top-level control file allowing continuous integration using
    Travis CI has been added.

* Nullor expansion has been fixed in the `spice' and `spice-sdb'
  backends.

  - Element name prefix "E_" has been substituted for "E-" to prevent
    errors output by some simulators (e.g. ngspice).

  - A default gain value has been added in the nullor expansion code.

* Two obsolete scripts verilog2vhdl.sh and script.sed have been
  removed.

* Undocumented and ambiguous feature of the `spice-sdb' backend for
  gnetlist consisting in the possibility of using the "value="
  attribute instead of "file=" only for include blocks and only in
  embedding mode has been removed.

* The following scripts and programs have been moved from the `utils'
  directory to a new `contrib' directory and are no longer installed
  by default:

         smash_megafile          olib
         gmk_sym                 convert_sym
         sarlacc_schem           sarlacc_sym
         pads_backannotate       sw2asc
         gnet_hier_verilog.sh

* `gpstoimage' has been removed from the distribution; equivalent
  functionality is provided by the `gaf' command.

* `convert_sym.awk' has been removed from the distribution; equivalent
  functionality is provided by the `convert_sym' command.

* gnetlist now supports output of netlists to the standard output.

* New Scheme procedures and hooks have been added.  Please see the
  "geda-scheme" info manual for more details.

  - `set-component-with-transform!' is a modified version of
    `set-component!', which applies all the specified transformations
    to a component and immediately updates it.

  - `auto-refdes-reset!' resets components' refdeses

  - `copy-objects-hook' is called whenever an object is copied, it can
    be used, for example, to reset component's refdes on copy.

* The following gschem configuration items have been added:

  - `third-button-cancel' cancels draw actions by the third mouse
    button in mousepan mode.

  - `grid-mode' sets default grid mode.

* Fixes/updates to the *BSD, Mac OS X, and MinGW builds.

* Changes in the gschem UI event state machine:

  - New drawing modes apply immediately.

  - Indication of an action being in progress has been added.

  - Mirror action can now be used during an object placement.

  - Show/hide text function is now enabled during other actions.

  - RMB panning is now enabled during placing or drawing.

* Some gschem dialog have been merged, made non-modal, and placed in
  sidebar:

  - Color, line, fill and pin type dialogs have been merged into one
    non-modal object properties dialog with widgets applying values
    immediately.

  - Text properties dialog.

  - Options to control the magnetic net mode and the net rubber band
    mode as well as grid mode and grid snap mode have been merged into
    one options dialog.

* The following dialogs/windows have been converted into an info bar
  and are now placed in bottom notebook:

  - Log (status) window.

  - Find text dialog.

* The following dialogs are now popup & docked the same way as the
  execute script dialog:

  - Show and hide text dialogs.

  - Translate dialog.

* Other gschem GUI changes:

  - Hotkeys and menu items to show/hide the sidebar and status window
    have been added.

  - Swatch for fill types has been added.

  - Slot edit dialog now displays number of slots.

  - Library folder structure in gschem is now displayed as tree.

  - Indication of page change has been added in gschem main window's
    title.

* Improved find text functionality:

  - When searching for text, gschem now descends all files specified
    in the comma separated list of the source attribute.

  - There is now a widget that lists all occurences of the text
    objects that contain the search string.

  - The find text operation does not switch the current schematic in
    the view or interfere with the most recent page up.

  - The find text operation also searches all open pages instead of
    the current one.

  - The behavior of the find text operation works with multiple
    toplevel windows open while running concurrent find text
    operations.

  - The find text operation can now use either a substring, pattern,
    or regex. The pattern style uses * and ?. The regex uses glib,
    which adheres to perl compatible regular expressions.

* Several symbols have been fixed/improved.

* gschemdoc has been enhanced to search in the user documentation
  directory.

* Several translations have been added/updated.

* Man pages for gsymcheck and gschlas have been updated.

* Switches --help and -h have been added for most of gEDA utilities.

* Fixed the following bugs:

  -  900122: Gschem crashes on ctrl-x.
  - 1258834: spice-sdb crashes on non-existing files.
  - 1463178: Gsch2pcb crashes when using `m4-pcbdir' option.
  - 1478760: Gschem segmentation fault during find text.
  - Gschem crashes on pressing the third mouse button.
  - SVG output bug in `gaf export'.
  - Several other bugs.


Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.9.1
=================================

* Unbalanced overbar markers are now rendered correctly.

* Most tools now no longer set the GEDADATA or GEDADATARC environment
  variables (they still obey them though).

* `gschem' now provides a path drawing tool, accessed using <A H> or
  the "Add Path" menu item.

  - Add a cusp node by left-clicking.

  - Add a Bezier curve node by left-dragging from the node point to
    the control point.

  - End the path by clicking on the same node point twice, or clicking
    on the start node to close the path.

* On desktops that reparent menu bars (e.g. Ubuntu Unity) it is once
  again possible to paste the clipboard using the menus.

* A number of `gschem' editing behaviour changes were made:

  - Double-clicking on an entry in the "In Use" tab of the component
    selector now behaves the same way as double-clicking in the
    "Libraries" tab.

  - When new attributes are attached to a net, they are placed at a 50
    unit offset.

  - The text color is now used as the default color for `pinlabel='
    attributes.

  - Pin attributes are no longer automatically replaced when rotating
    or mirroring pins.

  - It is possible to edit a text object even when other non-text
    objects are selected.

  - Control grips are now always drawn at the same on-screen size.

* The multi-attribute editor dialog in `gschem' has been extended to
  support more cases:

  - It now supports editing attributes of multiple selected
    objects. These are aggregated into the dialog's attribute list.

    Multiple attributes with the same name attached to any given
    object are still shown in separate rows, but identically named
    attributes from multiple selected objects will share a row. If a
    row has differing values between objects, its value shows the text
    "<various>" in a muted colour.

  - Where an attribute is present in some, but not all selected
    objects its name in the list is shown in red. A new popup menu
    option allows copying such attributes to all selected objects.

  - If no complex, placeholder, pin, net or bus objects are selected,
    the dialog now falls back to editing any selected attribute text.

    This allows editing of unattached or floating attributes in
    symbols, or any attributes seleccted independantly of their owning
    object. In this fallback mode, all attributes with the same name
    shown in separate rows, and the "add attribute" functionality is
    disabled.

* `gschem' has new icons for many editing commands.

* Several bugs were fixed in `gnetlist':

  - Invalid attributes are ignored.

  - Correct detection of graphical symbols.

  - Components with no `refdes=' attribute are reported.

  - Crash fixes for `drc' and `switcap' backends.

* `gaf export' now accepts a `--scale' option.

* The `--size', `--margins' and `--align' options to `gaf export' can
  now accept their multiple arguments separated with a space ` ', a
  colon `:' or a semicolon `;'.

* `gaf config' now handles the `-p' option properly.

* `gnetlist', `gsymcheck' and `gaf' now output internationalised
  messages.

* New Scheme procedures were added. Please see the "geda-scheme" info
  manual for more details.

  - The (gschem action) module contains procedures for working with
    user editing actions (i.e. commands accessed via the menus or
    keybindings).

  - Two new hooks were added: `bind-keys-hook' is called whenever
    keymap bindings are changed; `action-property-hook' is called when
    action properties are changed.


Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.9.0
=================================

* A new schematic renderer library, `libgedacairo' has been added, and
  all tools have been updated to use it.  Related changes:

  - The following configuration functions have been removed:

         output-capstyle         paper-sizes
         output-color            postscript-prolog
         output-orientation      print-command
         output-type             setpagedevice-orientation
         paper-size              setpagedevice-pagesize

  - The following `gschem' configuration items have been added:

         print-paper             print-color
         print-orientation

  - `gschem' now generates PDF files rather than PostScript or EPS
    files.

  - `gschem' now uses a standard GTK print dialog (with printer
    selection, print preview, etc.)

* A new `gaf' command-line utility has been added.  It provides a
  number of subcommands:

  - `gaf export' can be used to convert schematic files to PNG, SVG,
    PDF, PS and EPS, with detailed control of paper size and margins.
    It supports multi-page PDF and PS output.

  - `gaf config' can be used to manipulate the project, user, and
    system configuration stores (see below).

  - `gaf shell' provides a Scheme REPL for batch manipulation of
    schematic and symbol files.

* New project, user and system configuration stores have been added,
  using a format similar to .desktop files.  They can be manipulated
  using the `gaf config' tool.  Configuration parameters for most
  tools will be converted to use this mechanism in future releases.

* The changes to highlighting of dangling net ends in gEDA/gaf 1.8.0
  have been reverted.  All dangling ends are once again flagged with a
  brightly-coloured square.

* When editing a component with the `gschem' multi-attribute editor,
  the dialog will now show the symbol name in its title.

* When using "Down Schematic" command in `gschem', an error message
  will now be displayed if the subcircuit schematic cannot be loaded.

* Printing now uses a light background color map by default.

* Objects can now have the line end "cap style" adjusted in `gschem'.

* `gnetlist' now accepts the `-i' and `-g' command-line arguments
  together.  If you specify both `-i' and `-g', `gnetlist' will enter
  the Scheme REPL after loading the requested backend but before
  executing it.

* `gattrib' now has translations for the user interface and various
  messages.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.8.2
=================================

Bugfix release.

* [994361] Fixed a libgeda crash bug involving nets inside symbols.

* [1226246] Fixed a gnetlist data corruption bug when using refdes
  containing the string "POWER".

* Updates to build system to allow compilation from git on systems
  with Automake >= 1.13.0.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.8.1
=================================

Bugfix release with correct dynamic version information for libgeda.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.8.0
=================================

* `gschem' and `gnetlist' have updated and rewritten user guides.

* All tools now give more informative error messages if they are
  unable to load schematic or symbol files due to syntax errors.

* All tools now correctly handle schematic and symbol files with `\r',
  `\n', or `\r\n` line endings, or a mixture.

* Unconnected pin ends and net ends are now all drawn with the same
  box marker in `gschem' and printed output.

* Net segments with at least two connections (including indirect
  connections via `netname=' attributes) are now drawn with arrowheads
  rather than box markers on dangling ends in `gschem' and printed
  output.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.7.2
=================================

* `geda-gaf' now requires GTK+ 2.16.0 or later.

* A greatly expanded Scheme API has been added to gEDA/gaf for use by
  extension authors.  See the `geda-scheme' Info manual for more
  details.  Existing extensions may need to be modified to load the
  `(geda deprecated)' or `(gschem deprecated)' modules.

* The `component-library-search' function for `gafrc' files now skips
  directories without symbols, and searches for libraries recursively.

* `gschem' keybinding improvements:

  - Keybindings are now unaffected by Caps Lock.

  - Keystrokes are displayed using the same characters as on keycaps
    (e.g. `:' instead of `colon').

  - Keystrokes may use extended modifiers (Super, Hyper and Meta).

  - Key bindings can be modified in any rc file or interactively using
    the `global-set-key' function.  See notes in `system-gschemrc' for
    examples.

* `gschem' now displays help files and component documentation on all
  platforms, including Windows.  The `locate' tool is no longer used
  to search for component documentation files.

* The `schdiff' tool for generating visual diffs of schematics and
  symbols has been added.  It can be used with most version control
  systems.  See `man schdiff' for more details.

* The `bom' and `bom2' backends to `gnetlist' now give error messages
  if no attribute file can be found.  The `-O attrib_file=FILE' and
  `-O attribs=ATTRIB,ATTRIB...' options have also been added.

* A new `ewnet' backend has been added to `gnetlist'.  This outputs
  netlists for use with the National Instruments ULTIboard layout
  tool.

* The `verilog' backend to `gnetlist' now supports concatenated net
  naming like "{a,b,c[3:0]}".

* `gsch2pcb' no longer supports the `m4_command' parameter in project
  files.

* The `--m4-pcbdir' and `--m4-file' arguments to `gsch2pcb' now work
  again.

* `gsymfix.pl' has been renamed to `gsymfix'.

* Man pages are now available for all programs installed as part of
  gEDA/gaf.

* The undocumented programs `gnet_hier_verilog', `gsymupdate', `gschupdate'
  and `sch2eaglepos.sh' are no longer installed to ${prefix}/bin.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.7.1
=================================

* gEDA is now compatible with Guile 2.0.

* gEDA/gaf applications no longer complain when trying to load an rc
  file twice, or when an rc file doesn't exist.

* `gschem' allows objects to be moved by dragging without having to
  select them first.

* `gschem' now supports keybindings with more than one modifier key,
  and "Deselect" is bound to <Control Shift A> by default.

* `gnetlist' correctly handles multiple renames of the same net.  This
  resolves some long-standing bugs with multipage schematics.

* The `spice-sdb' backend for `gnetlist' now has built-in support for
  `SUBCKT_NMOS' and `SUBCKT_PMOS' devices.

* A new `makedepend' backend has been added to `gnetlist'.  It
  generates Makefile code for SPICE simulation dependencies.

* Visibility of embedded component attributes are now preserved by
  `gattrib'.

* `gsch2pcb' correctly handles footprint names with hyphens (`-').

* `gsch2pcb' project files support quoting and escaping in
  `schematics' entries.

* Considerable enhancements to Unicode support when printing
  schematics or exporting PostScript.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.7.0
=================================

* All gEDA/gaf applications now handle configuration files much more
  strictly, and provide much more useful feedback when an error
  occurs.

* Several changes to `gschem' command-line options:

  - The `-t' option is no longer supported.

  - Several command-line options now support a long-form alternative.

  - The `-s' option can now be used to run multiple Scheme scripts
    during `gschem' startup.

  - A new `-c' option is available, which runs a Scheme expression
    during `gschem' startup.

  - A new `-L' option is available, which adds a directory to the
    Scheme load path.

  - A new `-V' or `--version' option is available, which displays
    version information.

* `gschem' now provides a "Select All" function, which is bound to
  <Control a> by default, along with a corresponding "Deselect"
  function.

* In the `gschem' "Add component" dialog, filtering the component
  library will expand matching libraries.  If the filter is cancelled,
  all libraries are collapsed.  Components can now be selected by
  double-clicking on them in the component list.

* The `gschem' "Edit Text Properties" dialog now has an easier to use
  "Alignment" menu.

* Printed text size now better matches on-screen text size in
  `gschem'.

* Special characters, including commas, are now escaped or quoted
  appropriately in `gattrib' CSV output.

* Several changes to `gnetlist' command-line options:

  - Four command-line options specific to the `spice-sdb' backend have
    been removed.  They can be replaced with `-O <option>' according
    to the following table:

        -e, --embedd              -O embedd_mode
        -I, --include             -O include_mode
        -n, --nomunge             -O nomunge_mode
        -s, --sort                -O sort_mode

  - The list of available backends is now obtained using a new
    `--list-backends' option.  `-g help' no longer outputs a list of
    backends.

  - A new `-L' option is available, which adds a directory to the
    Scheme load path.

  - A new `-V' or `--version' option is available, which displays
    version information.

  - When run with invalid command-line arguments, `gnetlist' now exits
    with non-zero exit status.

* Several `gnetlist' backends have now been fixed so that it should no
  longer be necessary to set an expanded Guile stack in gEDA's config
  files.

* The `spice-sdb' backend for `gnetlist' now supports probes
  (`TESTPOINT' devices).

* The undocumented `mk_verilog_syms' program is no longer installed.
  The symbols it creates are still installed to
  `${prefix}/share/gEDA/sym/verilog'.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.6.2
=================================

 * PNG export from `gschem' will now be cropped correctly.

 * The `partlist' backends for `gnetlist' now handle hierarchical
   refdes correctly.

 * On Windows, `gschem' and `gattrib' will no longer launch with a
   command window visible.

 * `gnetlist-arg' is no longer valid in `gsch2pcb' project files.

Several other bugs were fixed, including a major crash bug in
gnetlist.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.6.1
=================================

* Added accelerator mnemonics for root menus in gschem

* Lots of updated and new language translations in libgeda, gschem, and
  gattrib.  (Courtesy of language translators and Launchpad)

* Updated the shipped documentation from the official gEDA wiki

* Fixed the following bugs:

  - 2876373: Fix rendering with zoomed out dashed lines
  - 2901183: Fix for some manpage issues
  - 2904715: Don't update page connectivity from o_place_rotate()
  - 2949232: Fix slot editing routines to not edit inherited attributes
  - Cherry picked some other bug fixes from master that should be in
    this release

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.6.0
=================================

* Fixed the GtkItemEntry code inside of gattrib code so that it builds
  using gtk+ > 2.16.x.

* In gschem, rubberband pin to pin connections by adding nets.

* Cleanup of the slot handling code in libgeda.

* Fixes/updates to the MinGW port.

* Updated the shipped documentation from the online wiki.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.5.3/1.5.4
=======================================

* NOTE: gEDA/gaf 1.5.3 was released with some critical bugs, so
        it was withdrawn before it was widely distributed.

* Text rendering using native system fonts:

  - The various programs in gEDA/gaf no longer uses its own built-in
    line font.

  - Native system fonts are used for rendering, giving support for a
    wider range of symbols, and better looking schematics.

* Always use PostScript fonts in gschem's PostScript output.  The
  "output-text", "text-output" and "output-vector-threshold" config
  functions have been removed.

* Image rendering in 'gschem' uses cairo instead of GDK.

* Numerous build system changes:

  - gEDA/gaf is now distributed as a single source archive, called
    gEDA-<version>.tar.gz.

  - GTK+ 2.10 or newer and Guile 1.8 or newer are now required.

  - `intltool' is no longer required.

  - Documentation is now installed to ${docdir} (usually
    ${prefix}/share/doc/gEDA).

* The attribute edit dialog in `gschem' now has completion of most
  common attribute names.

* The multi-attribute edit dialog in `gschem' now shows unpromoted
  symbol attributes.

* Menu items in `gschem' now have icons and properly aligned key
  bindings. They also support accelerator keys.

* The `gschem2pcb' and `PCBboard' netlist backends have been removed.
  It is recommended to use `gsch2pcb' instead.

* Check for and reject non-footprint PCB files in 'gsch2pcb'.

* Removed unimplemented "File->Open" feature in 'gattrib'.

* Added --disable-gattrib command line flag to ./configure to disable the
  building of 'gattrib'.  This is useful if you are building against
  gtk+ 2.17.x which breaks 'gattrib'.

* 'gnetlist' does not recommend drc2 every time it runs.  The drc2
  backend is only useful in certain circumstances.

* Assign shortcuts "vd" and "vl" for changing between color schemes
  in 'gschem'.

* Fix problem with attached net attribute not being honored in 'gnetlist'.

* Focus the "save" button in the close confirmation dialog in 'gattrib' and
  'gschem'.

* Accept empty attributes in the src file in 'tragesym'.

* Cleaned up the slot dialog box in 'gschem'.

* Changed the grip size rendering in 'gschem' to be reasonably sized when
  zoomed in a lot.

* Introduction of a new attribute searching API in 'libgeda' and 'gschem'.

* Improvements and cleanup to the 'gnetlist' and 'gsymcheck' test suites.

* Fixed the following bugs:

  - 1758673: Combine source tarballs
  - 2058707: gschem, gattrib: Dangerous button focus in "Save changes"
             dialog at quit
  - 2430369: gschem: Deselect invisible attribs with their parent object.
  - 2449060: Graphic state left inconsistent cancelling from net mode
  - 2460301: libgeda: Make o_complex_promote_attribs() respect keep_invisible
             and libgeda: Make o_complex_copy() actually copy.
  - 2455061: Gnetlist output changed, and tests fail with recent GLib
  - 2655088: autogen.sh: Make sure to exit if autopoint fails.
  - 2823703: gnet-pcbpins.scm: Quote pins names if they contain comma
             or close parenthesis.
  - 2823755: gnetlist: Fix DEBUG builds.
  - 2836109: build-sys: Add check for groff html driver.

* Spanish translation were updated.

* Lots of code, infrastructure, and doxygen documentation cleanup and
  refactoring.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.5.2
=================================

* `gschem' now uses Cairo for all rendering.  This allows for
  everything to be rendered anti-aliased.

* `gschem' now uses a mesh grid instead of dots by default.

* Net junction cues in `gschem' are drawn smaller now.

* Copy and paste now works between different `gschem' instances (using
  the X selection).

* Recent files are no longer opened in a new `gschem' window.

* Major, *backwards-incompatible* changes to color handling in
  `libgeda' and `gschem'.

  - All colors are specified using hexadecimal `#RRGGBB' or
    `#RRGGBBAA' syntax.

  - The print and display color maps are now separate.

  - A new Scheme syntax is used to inspect and modify color maps.

  - If you wish to use a light background in `gschem', add the line:

      (load (build-path geda-rc-path "gschem-colormap-lightbg"))

    to your personal or project gschemrc file.

* Attributes of embedded objects are now shown in the right color.

* Bus pins are now supported by `gschem' and `libgeda', but are *not*
  properly supported by the netlister.  The pin type can be modified
  by selecting a pin, then right-clicking it and selecting `Edit pin
  type...'.

* All of the symbols were modified to use overbar markup tags ("like
  \_this\_") instead of separate lines.

* Log files are now saved to $HOME/.gEDA/logs rather than being
  dropped in the current directory.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.5.1
=================================

* GTK+ version 2.8.x or later is now required.

* The selection behaviour in `gschem' was changed.

  - Lines, unfilled boxes, unfilled circles, arcs, pins, nets, and
    buses must be selected by clicking on the drawn path itself.

  - Filled boxes, circles, text, and components, may be selected by
    clicking anywhere in the bounding box.

  - The default mouse click distance required to select an element was
    increased to 10 pixels.

  - Double-clicking on a net segment selects all connected net
    segments.

* The percentage step in or out while zooming the display in `gschem'
  is now configurable with the `zoom-gain' gschemrc parameter.  The
  default value is 20%.

* The size of steps when panning with the mouse wheel or with a
  trackpad in `gschem' is now adjustable with the `scrollpan-steps'
  gschemrc parameter.  The default setting scrolls in steps of 1/8 of
  a screen.

* A number of improvements were made to the `gschem' component
  selection dialog.

  - The dialog now shows a table of top-level attributes in the
    selected symbol.

  - It is now possible to expand/collapse a library by clicking
    anywhere on its row.

* Changes to fill- and line-styles in `gschem' can now be undone.

* Arcs can now be adjusted in `gschem' using an arc angle dialog.  It
  can be accessed by selecting an arc and selecting Edit->Edit.

* It is now possible to rotate objects while placing them in `gschem'.

* Support for arbitrary filled and unfilled paths, using a subset of
  the SVG path syntax.  For more information, please see the file
  format specification.
  <http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:file_format_spec>

  - `gschem' does not yet provide a GUI for creating or editing path
    elements.  However, it does support rendering them.  They can also
    be printed.

  - Some of the symbols in the component library were updated to use
    paths.

* A Scheme evaluation prompt was added to `gschem'.  It can be
  accessed by typing `:'.

* Improved algorithm for drawing hatched fills both on screen and in
  PostScript output.

* Color selection dialogs and menus in `gschem' now show the actual
  color as well as the description.  Color names are now translatable.

* `gattrib' now prompts to save changes.

* All of the unimplemented menu items and pages in `gattrib' were
  removed.

* The `always-promote-attributes' gafrc parameter now takes a list of
  strings as an argument.  The space-delimited string syntax is
  deprecated.

* Some optimisations were made to the `gnetlist' connection traversal
  algorithm to speed up netlisting large designs.

* A new netlist backend was added to support Liquid PCB.
  <http://www.liquidpcb.org/>

* The `bom2' netlist backend now generates a `qty' column.

* Several improvements and fixes were made to the `systemc' backend.

* The `--gnetlist-arg' option to gsch2pcb can now be used to pass
  extra `gnetlist' arguments.

* `gsch2pcb' now emits files with the latest `pcb' file format.

* The `gxyrs' pick-and-place tool was added.

Notable changes in gEDA/gaf 1.5.0
=================================

* Magnetic net mode in `gschem'. Magnetic mode lets you draw nets and
  automatically connect to valid end points (such as pins and other
  nets).  The `magnetic-net-mode' gschemrc parameter can be used to
  enable/disable this feature.

* Rotating a component while moving it in `gschem' now rotates around
  the current mouse location.

* The `verilog' and `vhdl' backends now work again.

* Embedded components can now be mirrored.

* The `pads' netlist backend now uses CRLF line endings.

Older versions
==============

Release notes for older versions of gEDA/gaf are available on the gEDA
