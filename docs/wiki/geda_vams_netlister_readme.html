   The purpose of our endevour, is that gEDA gnelist completly
   supportted VHDL-AMS (VHDL Analog and Mixed-Signal) netlist
   generation. 

   The VHDL-AMS netlist support mode is called vams.


   1. FUNCTIONALITY

   gEDA gnetlist in vams mode allow it to generate a VHDL-AMS
   ARCHITECTURE or an ENTIY declaration. Which of both tasks is
   performed, dependends on the generate-mode variable. This variable
   is defined in the gnetlist command or will be set default.

   If generate-mode=1 (default) gnetlist creates a netlist as an
   VHDL-AMS ARCHITECTURE of the current schematic. Otherwise
   (generate-mode=2), it creates an VHDL-AMS ENTITY declaration of the
   selected component (this task needs information from gEDA gschem,
   see below).

   Now follows a stepwise discription of the program run in both
   submodes.

   We presuppose that you are familiar with the structure of gEDA
   gnetlist usage (otherwise try gnetlist -help) and that you have
   ever seen an VHDL-AMS ARCHITECTURE with its belonging ENTITY. If
   you does not then the following distription will be seems very
   strange to you. Maybe the syntax files (syntax_entity.txt,
   syntax_architeture.txt) can helps you further.
   
   ==================================================================
     
   1.1. ARCHITECTURE GENERATION

   
   We suppose generate-mode is equal to 1, from this it follows that
   vams creates a netlist as an ARCHITECTURE (saved to
   &lt;value-of-toplevel-attribute-entity&gt;_arc.&lt;output-fileextension&gt;).


     ARCHITECTURE &lt;architecture-identifier&gt; OF &lt;entity-identifier&gt; IS 

   The architecture-identifier we are getting from the toplevel
   attribute architecture, which we have introduced. If it is not
   defined, we are setting architecture-identifier default
   (default_architecture).  The same have we doing with the
   entity-identifier (toplevel attribute entity, default_entity).


     {&lt;subnet-object&gt; &lt;subnet-name&gt; : subnet-kind;}
  
   In the signal declaration part all subnets of the schematic will be
   declarated. A subnet declaration consists of an net-object, a
   net-name and a net-kind. All subnets are connected to various
   components pins. If this pins have all the same port-object and the
   same port-kind it is ok, but if one of them different, the net is
   faulty, and will be not declarated. Moreover, if the subnet-object
   a quantity, then it will be checked, whether the subnet consists
   exactly one output pin (port-mode), else the subnet is faulty too.
   The three net attributes (object, kind, mode) we are getting from
   the pin attribs, port_kind, port_object and port_mode (which we
   have introduced newly) of a component pin.

     
     BEGIN
	
   Ok. it&#039;s only marks the start of the architecture body.


     {&lt;label&gt; : ENTITY &lt;entity&gt; [(&lt;architecture&gt;)]
	    [GENERIC MAP (&lt;set generic&gt; =&gt; &lt;generic-value&gt;
			 {; &lt;set-generic=&gt; &lt;generic-value&gt;})]
            PORT MAP ( &lt;pin-name&gt; =&gt; &lt;subnet-name&gt;{; &lt;.. =&gt; ..&gt;});}
 
   We only support component instantiation statements, like this
   above, because we generate simple VHDL-AMS netlists. The label of
   an instance is defined from the uref of the instanciated
   component. Watch out, this label must be unique,it is not checked
   anywhere. The entity variable is not the same as the
   entity-identifier, it is the value of the device attribute which on
   its part identifies the precompiled ENTITY of this special
   component. Similar is the architecture variable belonging to the
   instanciated components ARCHITECTURE (note: one ENTITY can have more
   ARCHITECTURES), hence we are getting it from the component
   attribute ARCHITECTURE (newly introduced).

   All generics of the generic-list are component parameters, which
   are different from its default values (set in its ENTITY
   declaration). How can we distinguish them?  All defined generics
   are attached to the component and looks like :

	   &lt;attribute-name&gt;=?&lt;default-value&gt; &lt;- default, not in
					        generic-list 
     
   And if you want to change a parameter, you only must delete the
   ?-character and replace the default-value with your wanted value,
   like this :

           &lt;attribute-name&gt;=&lt;new-value&gt; &lt;- element of generic list 
	   
   If you do it this way, the new assigned value and its attribute-name
   will be appear in the GENERIC MAP (set-generic=attribute-name and
   generic-value=new-value).

   The PORT MAP consists of all pins of a component and which nets
   them connected to. The pin-name is getting from the pin# attribute
   of the pin and the subnet-name means the value of the label
   attribute of a net (mostly default named), which the pin is
   connected to. If the pin directly wired to a PORT component (=
   component, which device attribute =PORT), then we assign the uref
   of this component to subnet-name.


     END ARCHITECTURE &lt;architecture-identifier&gt;;

   I think, this line needs no more explanation. The
   architecture-identifier is the same like in the first line of
   ARCHITECTURE declaration. Hence, the ARCHITECTURE part ends here.

   ==================================================================
     
   1.2. ENTITY GENERATION


   Now, we suppose generate-mode is equal to 2, from this it follows
   that vams creates an ENTITY declaration of a component (save to
   &lt;component-device&gt;.vhdl). If there no component selected (empty
   top-attribs list) then it will be created an toplevel ENTITY of the
   current schematic (save to
   &lt;value-of-toplevel-attribute-entity&gt;.vhdl).


     LIBRARY &lt;library-identifier&gt;{,&lt;library-identifier&gt;};
     USE     &lt;package-identidier&gt;{,&lt;package-identifier&gt;};
 
   Well, the context clause part is not very ingenious. All libraries
   and packages you needs for your simulation you must insert staticly
   (a library contents precompiled ENTITIES, ARCHITECTURES and
   PACKAGES, which are needed from base components [base of the
   hierachical netlist] of your schematic. a package contents
   predefined types, constants, ...).  We are searching for a better
   usability of this part.

     
     ENTITY &lt;entity-identifier&gt; IS 
	 [genric_clause]
	 [port_clause]
     END ENTITY;

   If you want generate a toplevel ENTITY of your current schematic
   then the entity-identifier is defined from the toplevel attribute
   entity of the schematic-file. Moreover, there are no generic_clause
   and no port_clause.

   In case of an component based ENTITY declaration, the
   entity-identifier is getting from the device attribute of the
   selected component (this attribute is included in top-attribs list,
   which is defined in the automatic generated gnetlist command .. more
   about this, later).


     generic_clause :=
	       GENERIC ( &lt;generic-identifier&gt; : REAL := &lt;default-value&gt;
	                {;&lt;generic-identifier&gt; : REAL := &lt;default-value&gt;});

   All needed generic-identifiers and it default-values are getting
   from the top-attribs list. Note: all attached attributes of a
   component appears in the generic_clause, only special attributes,
   like uref, source and architecture, are taked out. The values of
   this attributes are taked from the top-attribs list, too, but it
   does not matter whether the value starts with a ?-character or not
   (?-character always will be deleted, if it exist in front of a
   value).


     port_clause :=
            PORT (&lt;port-kind&gt; &lt;port-identifier&gt; : [&lt;port-mode&gt;] &lt;port-type&gt;
	          {;&lt;port-kind&gt; &lt;port-identifier&gt; : [&lt;port-mode&gt;] &lt;port-type&gt;});

   All variables of this clause are grabbed from the symbol of the
   selected component. Port-kind corresponds with the value of the
   port_kind attribute of the pin, which pin# attribute value is equal
   to port-identifier. Just as corresponds port-type with the the
   value of the pin attribute port_type and port-mode with the value
   of port_mode.
	
   ===================================================================

   1.3. AUTOMATISATING gnetlist CALLS

   Because it is very arduous to type the whole gnetlist command,
   which all its parameters, per hand into the terminal, we are
   implement an automatisation of this process in gEDA gschem. This
   makes it possible to create a VHDL-AMS ARCHITECTURE or ENTITY
   whitout any commandline actions. The only thing you must do, is to
   use one of the following hotkeys:
      
	    &lt;g e&gt; for generating an ENTITY 
	    &lt;g n&gt; for genarating an ARCHITECTURE.
     
	NOTE to &lt;g e&gt; - hotkey : If one component of the schematic
				 selected then the ENTITY generation 
				 will be applied to this component !!

   ===================================================================			

   2. IMPLEMENTATION
     
   At this section it will be explained the basic concept of the
   implementation, which is splited in two sections. The first one
   aimed to the gnelist implementation and the second to the gschem
   implementation. 

     
   2.1. THE VAMS MODE OF gEDA gnetlist

   To realize gnetlist VHDL-AMS support, it was necessary to create
   new scheme and c stuff.


   2.1.1. SCHEME 

   The scheme implementation contents two parts. On one hand the new
   file gnet-vams.scm, which realize the VHDL-AMS-code generation, and
   on the other hand some settings in rc-files.

     
   2.1.1.1. SETTINGS AND NEW DEFINITIONS

   The following lines insert in your gschemrc, or wherever you want,
   but it must be loaded at gnetlist startup.
	 		
	   - load two modules, which we needs in our new implementation.

	     (define-module (ice-9 ls) :use-module (ice-9 common-list)
		                       :use-module (ice-9 string-fun))	   

           - load main file for VHDL-AMS support, which contents the 
	     startup procedure vams.

	     (load &quot;&lt;path_of_gnet-vams.scm&gt;/gnet-vams.scm&quot;)


   2.1.1.2. gnet-vams.scm

   This file contents all necessary scheme-functions to generate
   VHDL-AMS-code. Especially, the main procedure vams, which can be
   execute from the gnetlist command.
	 
	 For example : 
	     
		gnetlist -g vams schematic_filename.sch

      ...

      
   2.1.2.1. ROUTINES MAIN STRUCTURE

   the mainly functions structure looks like:

   - (vams output-filename)
 
     ARCHITECTURE generation

	- (vams:write-secondary-unit architecture entity  output-port)

	    - (vams:write-architecture-declarative-part output-port)
		  - (vams:write-signal-declarations output-port)

	    - (vams:write-architecture-statement-part packages output-port)
	          - (vams:write-generic-map output-port package)
		  - (vams:write-port-map package output-port)

     ENTITY declaraction

	 - (vams:write-primary-unit entity port-list generic-list output-port)     
	    
	     - (vams:write-context-clause output-port)

	     - (vams:write-generic-clause generic-list output-port)
		  - (vams:write-generic-list generic-list output-port)

	     - (vams:write-port-clause port-list output-port)
		  - (vams:write-port-list port-list output-port)


   2.1.1.3 HELPFULLY SETTING IN THE gEDA gschem ENVIRONMENT   

   This settings are not absolutly necessary, but they makes work
   easier.

	- set in .gEDA/gschemrc or wherever you want, but place it
	  right.

	   	(attribute-promotion &quot;enable&quot;) 	   
		(promote-invisible &quot;enable&quot;)
		(enforce-hierarchy &quot;disabled&quot;)
         
		(attribute-name &quot;port_object&quot;)
		(attribute-name &quot;port_type&quot;)
		(attribute-name &quot;port_mode&quot;)
		(attribute-name &quot;entity&quot;)
		(attribute-name &quot;architecture&quot;)


   2.1.2. NEW C - CODE 
      
   To got all informations, which we needed for currently netlist 
   generation, we must implemented two new c - functions.

   
   2.1.2.1 NEW ROUTINES (saved in vams_misc.c)


     SCM vams_get_package_attributes(SCM scm_uref)

   The first function gets all attribute names (not its values) of a
   component. This routine requires the name a component (package),
   especially the uref of it, and returns a list of all attribute
   names which are attached to this package. 

   We needs this functionality to produce a currectly 
   VHDL-AMS GENERIC MAP.
 

     char* vams_get_attribs_list 
	   (OBJECT *object, SCM *list, OBJECT **return_found)

   It exists only for the support of the first function.
	   

   2.1.2.2. CODE ADAPTATION
	 
   To place this new functions at gnetlist scheme&#039;s disposal, you must
   perform the following actions.
	 
     (1) gnetlist/src/g_register.c
	 
	   gh_new_procedure1_0 
	       (&quot;gnetlist:vams-get-package-attributes&quot;, 
	         vams_get_package_attributes);
	 

     (2) gnetlist/include/prototype.h
	     
	   SCM vams_get_package_attributes(SCM scm_uref);
	     

     (3) edit gnetlist/src/Makefile.in or directly in Makefile
	     
	 (if you have edited Makefile.in you must run make config of
	 course)
	     
	  - add &quot;vams_misc.c&quot; to gnetlist_SOURCES - variable
	  - add &quot;vams_misc.o&quot; to gnetlist_OBJECTS - variable
	     
     (4) copy vams_misc.c to gEDA/gnetlist/src/

     (5) compile your code newly

   ===================================================================	

   2.2. AUTOMATIC GENERATING gnetlist CALLS IN gEDA gschem

   To realize this new feature it was necessary to put more
   information from the schematic to the scheme world of gEDA gschem.
   Concretly, we needs the filename of the current schematic, because
   gEDA gnetlist required it, and the attached attributes of a
   selected component for creating an VHDL-AMS ENTITY.  Hence, the
   gnetlist command is mutated to an unidirectional interface between
   the world of gschem scheme and the world of gnetlist scheme.
   
   There are three important things, which transfer through this
   interface:
   
	(1) the source-file, which contents the complett filename
	    (with path) of the current schematic.

	(2) the top-attribs list, which contents all attached
            attributes of the selected component.

	(3) the generate-mode, which is defined by the users actions.


   2.2.1. STRUCTURE OF gEDA gnetlist CALLS FROM COMMANDLINE OR FROM gEDA
	  gschem.

     typical commandline call :
     
		gnetlist [-o &lt;output-filename&gt;] 
			 -g vams
			 &lt;schematic-file&gt;

   There are nothing to explain. The top-attribs list and the
   generate-mode variable are default defined (&#039;() and 1).


   calls from gEDA gschem (3 possible variations) :


   Note: vhdl-path is a predefined variable, which is set in
	 generate_netlist.scm first times. You can it simple redefine
	 in your local gschemrc file, which is loading everytimes you
	 starts gEDA gschem.

     
     (1) hot-key-stroke: - g n  (generate netlist)
	 
	 --&gt; generates a netlist of the current schematic. 
	     
	 
	     gnetlist -o &lt;vhdl-path&gt;/&lt;target-file&gt;
		      -g vams
		      &lt;source-file&gt;

          The source-file variable is equate to the complett
          path+filename of the current schematic, which we get with
          help of a self coded c function. If you cut out the filename
          of the source-file variable (source-file without path) then
          you are getting the target-file.generate-mode and
          top-attribs are default again.

      (2) hot-key-stroke: - g e (generate-entity) 
	  and no component is selected.  
	  
	  --&gt; generates an toplevel ENTITY of the current
	      schematic.


	      gnetlist -c &lt;scheme-comm&gt;
		       -o &lt;vhdl-path&gt;/&lt;target-file&gt;
		       -g vams
		       &lt;source-file&gt;

		  scheme-comm=&quot;(define top-attribs &#039;&lt;top-attribs&gt;)
			       (define generate-mode &#039;2)&quot;

	   
	   Source-file needs no comment, because it is the same as in
	   (1). To get all attributes of a selected component, we are 
	   must write a new c function again. The values, which we get 
	   from this new function are saved in top-attribs. The sense
	   of the scheme-comm command is to put top-attribs and 
	   generate-mode from the gschem to the gnetlist environment.
	   At last, the target-file consists of the pure basefilename
	   of the source-file and an .vhdl extention.

       (3) hot-key-stroke: - g e (generate-entity)
	   and only one component is selected.

	   --&gt; generates an ENTITY of the selected schematic.


	       commandline is the same as in (2).

	   
	   Differences: The target-file is different, but it does not
	   matter, because gnetlist generate an new output-filename in
	   in this case (&lt;device-name-of-selected-component&gt;.vhdl,
	   normally).But one fact is very important: the top-attribs
	   variable includes all attached attributes of the selected
	   component now.

   2.2.2. SCHEME

   The gnetlist command is generating from two scheme functions, which
   are saved in generate_netlist.scm. This functions starts if the
   gschem user is typing one of the specified hot-keys ([g e] starts
   generate-entity and [g n] starts generate-netlis). Both routines
   puts the whole gnetlist command together and execute it. The syntax
   you see above.


   2.2.2.1. generate_netlist.scm


   2.2.2.2. SETTINGS

   If you want use the new feature then you must do some entries in one
   of your gEDA gschem rc-files

     necessary defines:

	 - in system-gschemrc 
	 	   
		    (&quot;g&quot; . gnetlist-keymap)

	   Edit your global-keymap and if &quot;g&quot; always defined then find
	   out an other free hot-key-stroke.
 
	   Note: the documentation supports the &quot;g&quot; - key only.
	 

         - in one of the gschem startup files
		    
 	     (define gnetlist-keymap
	       &#039;((&quot;n&quot; . generate-netlist)
		 (&quot;e&quot; . generate-entity)))


     loads :

	    (load &quot;/home/fliser3/.gEDA/generate_netlist.scm&quot;)
	    
	    
   2.2.3. NEW C-CODE
   
   The c-code makes it possible to get directly informations from the
   gschem tool, which is necessary for the online execution of
   gnetlist.


   2.2.3.1. ROUTINES

   It exists two new c-functions. Both are put down in
   misc_for_gnetlist.c.

   
     SCM get_selected_filename(gpointer data,		
			  guint callback_action,	
			  GtkWidget *widget)

   This function returns the whole filename of the current schematic,
   which is picked from the w_current-&gt;page_current-&gt;page_filename
   string.


     SCM get_selected_component_attributes(gpointer data,		
				      guint callback_action,	
				      GtkWidget *widget)

   How the name is saying, this functions returns all attributes of
   the selected component. It is realized with a simple while loop
   over all objects of the schematic, which picked out all elements
   where the selected flag is set.


   2.2.3.2. CODE-ADAPTATION

   Here are some actions you must conclude to makes the software
   runable.

   (1) new lines in /gschem/src/g_register.c

	gh_new_procedure0_0 (&quot;get-selected-filename&quot;,g_get_selected_filename);


   (2) new lines in /gschem/include/prototype.h

	SCM g_get_selected_filename();


   (3) copy the file misc_for_gnetlist.c to gschem/src 

   (4) add in file /gschem/src/Makefile.in or directly in Makefile.

       (if you have edited Makefile.in you must run make config of
       course)
