<div class="level2">

<p>

In general, there are three types of changes that go into PCB - bug
fixes, new features, and incompatible changes.  A <em>bug fix</em> is when
PCB doesn&#039;t do what it&#039;s supposed to do - this includes documentation
bugs as well as code problems.  A <em>new feature</em> is something that
adds functionality to PCB but doesn&#039;t change any existing
functionality.  An <em>incompatible change</em> is anything that causes
(intentional) compatibility issues with older versions of PCB, and
usually means a large design change.  Note that a new feature that
adds a backwards-incompatible change to the file format <em>when it&#039;s
used</em> is not in this category.
</p>

<p>
The current plans are as follows:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Bug fix releases every two months or so until we clear the backlog.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Start on a PCB 4.0 release that folds in some large design changes we&#039;ve been talking about for years.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

At the moment, bugfix releases will be of the form <code>pcb-YYYYMMDD</code>.
Once 4.0 is released, the major.minor.bugfix numbers will correspond
to the three categories listed above: bugfixes cause a *.*.N release,
new features cause a *.N release, major changes cause a N.0 release.
The <code>YYYYMMDD</code> release numbers will then be used for regular
non-release snapshots.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this page will list the various changes that are
planned (or at least hoped for) for upcoming and future releases.
</p>

<p>
Bugs, patches, and feature requests should be added to the
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pcb" class="urlextern" title="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pcb"  rel="nofollow">Launchpad
trackers</a>.  The default status <strong>undecided</strong>.  Requests with that
priority will be considered “unreviewed”.

<p>

This is a list of new features that will be added before the next
feature release (or, perhaps the next bug release, if time permits).
</p>

<p>
Make the code C++ compatible.
</p>

<p>
Allow via annulii to overlap each other.
</p>

<p>
More route styles.
</p>

<p>
Nanometer resolution - this is the “metric units” change we&#039;ve talked
about many times.
</p>

<p>
Real layer types.  Silks, keepouts, mask docs at least.  Maybe
anti-draw or paste.

This section lists possible projects for future releases, which either
haven&#039;t been agreed on, or haven&#039;t been scheduled.  If you&#039;d like to
work on one of these, go ahead <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" align="middle" alt=":-)" />
</p>

<p>

Other <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> cleanups.  Gtk upgraded to “best practices”.  Importer config.
</p>

<p>
“New layout” templates and wizards. (instead of defaulting to 4&times;4 8-layer)
</p>

<p>
import/wizard plugins (as well as exports)
</p>

<p>
DRC cleanups/rewrite
</p>

<p>
CAM engine?  (i.e. ability to say “draw outline on top soldermask” via script/config)
</p>

<p>
Ability to hook into layer exporters (i.e. thindraw as a HID)
</p>

<p>
New file format we&#039;ve been discussing.
</p>

<p>
Variable-angle arcs. 90 degrees is extremely limiting.
</p>

<p>
Filled circles, sans kludge.  Currently, to get a filled circle you
create a zero-length trace of the right width.
</p>

<p>
Having all shapes that are supported for traces supported for 
footprint copper (arcs, polygons, circles, etcetera).
</p>

<p>
Unification of shortcuts in gschem and PCB, or at least an easy option 
for PCB to mimic gschem&#039;s shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
Better support for free-rotated components: assert that pads at funky 
angles are rendered correctly, fix autorouter for components at weird 
angles (the latest git version has a tendency to either ignore the route 
command or to segfault, depending on the specifics), add rotation to the 
ctrl-R report, etcetera.
</p>

<p>
Ability to copy a footprint&#039;s name from the library dialogue (so it 
can be pasted into gschem&#039;s attribute list).
</p>

<p>
Ability to edit netlist in-situ (possibly by drawing on the rat lines 
layer) - e.g, when you want to add a heatsink soldered to ground, it 
will always show up as shorted until the netlist is edited to 
incorporate it.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, blind and buried vias. It&#039;s big, reasonably 
important, and has been on people&#039;s wish lists for years.
</p>

<p>
Trace impedance calculator, with automatic adjustment capability (fill 
in thickness, stray capacitance and desired impedance, and the width is 
adjusted to satisfy the conditions).
</p>

<p>
Integrated footprint lookup and fetch from gedasymbols.org.
</p>

<p>
Heirarchical pcb model - subcells, footprints-as-pcb, etc.
</p>

<p>
A shape I&#039;ve often wanted on a pad is circle with the sides cut off.
This is slightly different than an oval.  Something like Inkscape&#039;s
boolean operations would be excellent.
</p>

<p>
How about text at not-90 degree angles?  Or support for rotated square
pads (I know, the file format doesn&#039;t support those two.)
</p>

<p>
Editing on the grid has got to go!  Counting grid points is the worst
possible way to enter positional information into a computer.
</p>

<p>
Make every field in object reports editable.
</p>

<p>
Allow direct entry of offsets and absolute positions when editing.
</p>

<p>
Add “offset” and “trim” feature à la 2D CAD programs.
</p>

<p>
Add “point to tangent” and “tangent to tangent” line drawing feature
à la 2D CAD programs.
</p>

<p>
Also, trim polygons against “outline” layer.  Fix polygons in general.
</p>

<p>
square/rectangular holes (e.g. mounting tabs)
</p>

<p>
Automatic least version required file saving.  Set the file format
version based on features used, not the version of PCB This will
become valuable as we add features like blind vias, custom pad stacks
etc….
