 Good news! The gEDA Project has been accepted as a mentoring organization by Google’s Summer of Code program! The alphabetized list of all projects participating in Google’s SoC is presented here: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" class="urlextern" title="http://code.google.com/soc/"  rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/soc/</a> </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 gEDA is listed as “The gEDA Project”. We are very pleased to be recognized as a participant in the Summer of Code project!
</p>

<p>
Now is the time for interested students to get their applications ready. Note that if you want to participate in the SoC, you must apply to Google, not to the gEDA Project. However, prior to making an application to Google, I suggest you contact one of us (Dan, Stuart) who can informally review your project proposal, and suggest a mentor for your project. The mentor will be one of the well-known developers who have worked on the gEDA Project for a while. The list of available mentors is shown at the bottom of this page. Your mentor will be your boss: he will help guide you through the code, refine your project requirements, answer questions, monitor your progress, and rate your performance at the middle and at the end of the project.
</p>

<p>
After that, you must apply directly to Google through this web page: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" class="urlextern" title="http://code.google.com/soc/"  rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/soc/</a> </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 Good luck with your application, and we look forward to working with you!
</p>

 The gEDA Project invites students to work with us under the auspices of Google’s Summer of Code program! We are a group of professional hardware and software engineers with an interest in developing CAD tools for electronic design under Linux (and other unix flavors). The project is over eight years old, and has matured to the point where our design tools are suitable for use by students, professionals, educators, hobbyists, consultants, and anybody who needs a set of quality EDA tools for Linux. Becoming involved in the gEDA Project is a great way to learn about both software engineering and electronics!
</p>

<p>
Details for student applications to Google can be found in the Google SOC Student <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym>. Students may find the list of gEDA Google SOC project suggestions useful. Note that students apply to Google for project approval, not to the gEDA Project! However, we encourage you to contact us early if you are interested in working on a gEDA Summer of Code project, since we can then hash out the details of your project and help you with your application. To contact us, please post a message on the geda-dev e-mail list. or contact one of the mentors directly.

<div class="level3">

<p>
 A Google Summer of Code project should be considered a full time job and will require that level of time commitment. In addition, there must be some working code committed in time for the midterm evaluation for a good review. Project Details
</p>

<p>
When submitting an application or project proposal, please include the following details about the project: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Summary of the project including the end goal. This should be a couple of paragraphs &ndash; enough to fully explain what you have in mind. Writing a couple of use-cases will help if you are creating a new program (as opposed to upgrading an existing one).</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Detail the scope of the project. What do you intend on delivering and what do you not intend on delivering. In best case, this will be a list of features/behaviors your program will possess.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Provide a timetable for the project, including milestones (i.e. what features will be working by when).</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Is this a rewrite/upgrade of existing software or is it a “from scratch” project.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Who is the mentor for your project? Ideally, your mentor will be one of the current gEDA developers, or will be a professor or professional EE familiar with the gEDA project. If you don’t know who should mentor your project, then we can help choose somebody for you based upon the project you have chosen.</div>

It is important for us to understand how your project will fit into the rest of gEDA. To help us understand this, also include the following information: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Which components of gEDA will be affected and require code changes? Examples are “only PCB” or “libgeda, gnetlist, gschem, and PCB”.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Are any new dependencies required over the existing ones? If so, what are they? Are the new dependencies widely ported? (Note that certain gEDA developers frown on new dependencies, so be prepared to thoughtfully defend your choice.)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Will these changes force a change in any existing work flows that users may currently be employing?</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Will your project enable a new work flow or a new feature which has hitherto been lacking in the gEDA Suite?</div>
</li>
