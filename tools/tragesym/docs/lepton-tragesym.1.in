.SH NAME
lepton-tragesym \- create Lepton EDA symbols from structured text files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-tragesym
.I SOURCE-FILE SYMBOL-FILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-tragesym
creates lepton-schematic symbols from structured text files.
.PP
.B lepton-tragesym
can:
.IP \(bu
create pins, their elements (clocksign, negation bubble), and
attributes (\*[lq]pinnumber\*[rq], \*[lq]pinseq\*[rq],
\*[lq]pintype\*[rq], and \*[lq]pinlabel\*[rq]);
.IP \(bu
sort the pins alphabetically by their attributes;
.IP \(bu
rotate pinlabel attributes of the top and bottom pins if requested;
.IP \(bu
swap words in the pinlabel attributes if requested (only for
attributes of the right and top pins, in the latter case only
if rotation is also requested);
.IP \(bu
do some syntax checking to the input file.

.SH SOURCE FILE FORMAT
.SS General

Source file is a text file consisting of three sections:
.br
.rs
\(bu
.B [geda_attr]
.br
.rs
\(bu
.B [options]
.br
.rs
\(bu
.B [pins]
.RE

Section name should be enclosed in square brackets.

Empty lines, lines consisting of whitespaces only, as well as
lines beginning with the character '#' (comments) are silently
ignored.

.SS [options]
The section contains export settings.  The following settings are
supported:

'IP \(bu
.B wordswap
.RI ( boolean )
.br
Swap labels if the pin is on the right side and contains space
between words, that is, looks like this: \*[lq]PB1 (CLK)\*[rq].
That may be useful for micro controller port labels.
'IP \(bu
.B rotate_labels
.RI ( boolean )
.br
Rotate the \*[lq]pinlabel\*[rq] attribute of the top and bottom pins
by 90 degrees.
This may be useful for large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100
pins.
'IP \(bu
.B sort_labels
.RI ( boolean )
.br
Sort the pins by their \*[lq]pinlabel\*[rq] attributes, which is
useful for address ports, busses, etc.
'IP \(bu
.B generate_pinseq
.RI ( boolean )
.br
Automatically generate \*[lq]pinseq\*[rq] attributes for those
pins whose corresponding field in the source file is empty.
The generated attribute values are numbers incremented in the
order the pin description lines appear in the
.B [pins]
section except for already existing numbers.

'IP \(bu
.B sym_width
.RI ( integer )
.br
Minimum box width of the resulting symbol.
'IP \(bu
.B pinwidthvertical
.RI ( integer )
.br
The vertical distance between pins on the left or right hand side
of the symbol.
'IP \(bu
.B pinwidthhorizontal
.RI ( integer )
.br
The horizontal distance between pins on the top or bottom of the
symbol.

The boolean values are specified in the source file by the words
\*[lq]yes\*[rq] or \*[lq]on\*[rq] meaning TRUE and \*[lq]no\*[rq]
or \*[lq]off\*[rq] meaning FALSE.

.SS [geda_attr]

The section contains the list of Lepton symbol attributes
(\*[lq]name=value\*[rq] pairs) which you would want to see in the symbol
file.
The attribute names may be separated by the equal or tabulation
character (\*[lq]=\*[rq] or \*[lq]\\t\*[rq]).
The tab separator is supported for convenient export from
spreadsheet programs.

.SS [pins]

The section contains the description of symbol pins to be made,
one pin per line.
The pin description consists of seven tab separated fields, any of
which may contain empty value (no character between tabs).
The fields define the following pin attributes and properties:

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step]. 3
\*[lq]pinnumber\*[rq] attribute
.br
The \*[lq]pinnumber\*[rq] attribute represents the physical number
of the component pin.
.IP \n+[step].
\*[lq]pinseq\*[rq] attribute
.br
The \*[lq]pinseq\*[rq] attribute is used in Lepton to assign pin
numbers for slotted components and by the SPICE backends to output
pins in right order.  Leave the field blank if it doesn't matter.
.IP \n+[step].
\*[lq]pintype\*[rq] attribute
.br
The \*[lq]pintype\*[rq] attribute defines the pin function (input,
output, power, etc.) and can be one of \*[lq]in\*[rq],
\*[lq]out\*[rq], \*[lq]io\*[rq], \*[lq]oc\*[rq], \*[lq]oe\*[rq],
\*[lq]pas\*[rq], \*[lq]tp\*[rq], \*[lq]tri\*[rq], \*[lq]clk\*[rq],
or \*[lq]pwr\*[rq].  The attribute is used by the DRC backends to
check component interconnection validity.
.IP \n+[step].
pin style
.br
Pin style determines the appearance of the pin.
It can be one of \*[lq]line\*[rq] (simple pin), \*[lq]dot\*[rq]
(pin with negation bubble), \*[lq]clk\*[rq] (pin with clock
symbol), \*[lq]dotclk\*[rq] (bubble and clock), \*[lq]spacer\*[rq]
(not a pin, just additional empty space between two pins), or
\*[lq]none\*[rq] (to add a virtual pin via the \*[lq]net\*[rq]
attribute).
.IP \n+[step].
pin position
.br
Pin position determines the side of the component the pin should
be placed on.
It can be \*[lq]l\*[rq] (left), \*[lq]r\*[rq] (right),
\*[lq]t\*[rq] (top), \*[lq]b\*[rq] (bottom), or empty
(\*[lq]\*[rq]) when the pin should be defined in the
\*[lq]net\*[rq] attribute.
.IP \n+[step].
pin net
.br
Specifies the net name of the pin to define via the
\*[lq]net\*[rq] attribute, for example, \*[lq]Vcc\*[rq] or
\*[lq]GND\*[rq].
.IP \n+[step].
\*[lq]pinlabel\*[rq] attribute
.br
The \*[lq]pinlabel\*[rq] attribute represents the visible pin
label defining its name in the component, for example
\*[lq]A\*[rq] (anode) or \*[lq]C\*[rq] (cathode) in a diode
symbol.
Negation lines can be added with \*[lq]\\_\*[rq], for example,
\*[lq]\\_enable\\_\*[rq].  If you want to add the character
\*[lq]\\\*[rq], use \*[lq]\\\\\*[rq] as escape sequence.
This is supported by `lepton-schematic`.
