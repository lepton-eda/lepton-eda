.SH NAME
.B lepton-pcb_backannotate
\- back-annotates changes from a PCB annotation file to schematic

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-pcb_backannotate \-h\||\-\-help

.B lepton-pcb_backannotate \-V\||\-\-version

.B lepton-pcb_backannotate
[options]
.I ecofile.eco infile1.sch ...


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.I lepton-pcb_backannotate
program reads an engineering change order (ECO) file generated by
the PCB program (using the Renumber() action) and back-annotates
the requested changes to a lepton-schematic schematic(s).
Currently it supports back annotation of reference designators
(refdes).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h, \-\-help
prints help message and exits
.TP
\-n, \-\-nocopy
Leave the modified schematic files in new files
whose names are generated by appending
.I ".new"
to the
original file names.  The default is to overwrite the original.
.TP
\-v, \-\-verbose
operate verbosely
.TP
\-V, \-\-version
prints version information and exits

.SH EXIT STATUS
.I lepton-pcb_backannotate
will return
.B 0
if all files processed successfully,
.B non-zero
if the command did not complete successfully.

.SH BUGS
Rather than parsing and processing schematic files directly, this
utility should be rewritten using the Lepton EDA scheme API.  This
would take advantage of the existing parsers for the schematic
files.
