.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBlepton-update\fR is a tool for updating old schematic and
symbols.

.PP
The program takes a schematic or symbol filenames on the command
line and updates them after making backups.  It is intended for
running against schematics which are either version 20030921 or
earlier.

.PP
For both symbols and schematics, the program fixes obsolete text
and pin format lines and sets the current format version.

.PP
For schematics, it replaces the \fIlabel=\fR attribute on nets with
\fInetname=\fR, and \fIuref=\fR with \fIrefdes=\fR.

For symbols, it changes them as follows:

.IP \[bu] 2
Converts all \fIpin#=#\fR attributes into \fIpinseq=\fR and
\fIpinnumber=\fR attributes.
.IP \[bu]
Converts all \fIslot#=#\fR attributes into \fIslotdef=\fR
attributes.
.IP \[bu]
Replaces pin attributes \fItype=\fR with \fIpintype=\fR.
.IP \[bu]
Replaces pin attributes \fIlabel=\fR with \fIpinlabel=\fR.
.IP \[bu]
Replaces symbol attribute \fIuref=\fR with \fIrefdes=\fR.
