.SH NAME
lepton-archive \- create and extract Lepton EDA design archives

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-archive
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.I FILE
\&...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-archive
creates and extracts Lepton EDA designs from an archive. The two
modes of operation are "archive mode" (archive creation) and
"extract mode".  In archive mode it creates a project archive from
a bunch of project files, and in extract mode it extracts the
files from the archive and places them in the local directory.
.PP
In archive mode the program processes schematic files traversing
their hierarchy using the "source=" attributes, collecting and
caching all subschematics, symbols and SPICE subcircuits specified
in the "file=" attributes.
.PP
Archive mode is the default.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
\-h, \-\-help             Print usage information.
\-V, \-\-version          Print version information.
\-v, \-\-verbose          Verbose mode.
\-f, \-\-files\-from=FILE  Additionally read filenames to archive
                       from FILE.
\-e, \-\-extract          Extract mode. Mandatory if you want to
                       extract from archive.
\-a, \-\-archive          Archive mode. It is the default mode.
\-o, \-\-output=FILE      Specify the name of the output archive file
                       in archive mode. If FILE has no ".tar.gz"
                       suffix it will be automatically appended.
                       Default file name is "project-archive.tar.gz".

.SH EXAMPLES
To create an archive named MyArchive.tar.gz, the files to store
are listed in "archive-list":
.IP
lepton-archive \-f archive-list \-o MyArchive.tar.gz
.PP
The same by using just file basename:
.IP
lepton-archive \-f archive-list \-o MyArchive
.PP
Verbosely create an archive from files listed on command line:
.IP
lepton-archive \-v README sch1.sch sch2.sch sch3.sch
.PP
Extract an archive:
.IP
lepton-archive \-e project-archive.tar.gz

The initial Python script has been written by Stuart Brorson

scratch in Scheme by Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>.
