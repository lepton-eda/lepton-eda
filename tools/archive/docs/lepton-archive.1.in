.SH NAME
lepton-archive \- create and extract Lepton EDA design archives

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-archive
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.I FILE
\&...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-archive
creates and extracts Lepton EDA designs from an archive. The two modes of
operation are "archive mode" (archive creation) and "extract mode".
In archive mode it creates a project archive from a bunch of project
files, and in extract mode it extracts the files from the archive and
places them in the local directory.
.PP
In archive mode the program processes schematic files traversing
their hierarchy, collecting and caching all subschematics, symbols
and subcircuits specified in the "file=" attributes.
.PP
Archive mode is the default.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
\-h, \-\-help             Print usage information.
\-v, \-\-verbose          Verbose mode.
\-f, \-\-files\-from=FILE  Additionally read filenames to archive from FILE.
\-e, \-\-extract          Extract mode. Mandatory if you want to extract from archive.
\-a, \-\-archive          Archive mode. It is the default mode.
\-o, \-\-output=FILE      Specify the name of the output archive file
                       in archive mode. If FILE has no ".tar.gz" suffix it will be
                       automatically appended.
                       Default file name is "project-archive.tar.gz".

.SH EXAMPLES
To create an archive named MyArchive.tar.gz, the files to store
are listed in "archive-list":
.IP
lepton-archive \-f archive-list \-o MyArchive.tar.gz
.PP
The same by using just file basename:
.IP
lepton-archive \-f archive-list \-o MyArchive
.PP
Verbosely create an archive from files listed on command line:
.IP
lepton-archive \-v README sch1.sch sch2.sch sch3.sch
.PP
Extract an archive:
.IP
lepton-archive \-e project-archive.tar.gz
