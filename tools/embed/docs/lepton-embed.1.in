.SH NAME
lepton-embed \- Embed/unembed schematic components and pictures

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-embed
\fB-e\fR | \fB-u\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIFILE\fR ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-embed
can embed the in-use schematic symbols and pictures into a schematic
or set of schematics.
It allows, for instance, putting a schematic on a website or in an email
without the recipient needing to download lots of custom symbols for the
design.
.PP
.B lepton-embed
can also unembed symbol references from a schematic, but note that the
symbols revert to library references; if the symbol doesn't exist in
the current Lepton EDA project's library path, a broken schematic results.
