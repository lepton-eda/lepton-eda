.SH NAME
.B lepton-schdiff
\- Graphical diff tool for schematics

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-schdiff
.I [-d VIEWER] infile1.sch infile2.sch


.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B lepton-schdiff
program will use
.B ImageMagick(1)
to display a graphical diff of two schematic files.  It's most useful
when combined with a revision control system so it can compare two revisions of
the same file, review changes, etc.  However, it is limited in that it can only
compare two files at a time; it cannot diff entire directories nor can it diff
an entire revision (unless that revision affected only one file).

\fIVIEWER\fR command, if specified, will be used to display the result.
By default, it's
.B display
program from the ImageMagick package.

.B lepton-schdiff
can easily be configured to work with most revision control systems.  Here are
instructions for three:

.B git:
Use the
.B difftool
command exactly as you would use
.B diff
, but supply the
.B \-x lepton-schdiff
option.

.B mercurial:
Use the
.B lepton-schdiff
command exactly as you would use
.B diff
, but add the following lines to your .hgrc:

.RS
  [extensions]
  hgext.extdiff =
  [extdiff]
  cmd.schdiff = lepton-schdiff
.RE

.B subversion:
Use the
.B diff
command like normal, but supply the
.B --diff-cmd lepton-schdiff
option.

.B Note:
To make lepton-schdiff work properly, all page contents
should be enclosed in some form of bounding box (e.g.
a title block), otherwise the symbols in exported
images could have different relative positions and/or
sizes, resulting in a difference image that is rather
hard to comprehend.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
Use git to view the changes to a file between two revisions
git difftool \-x lepton-schdiff 182110f 039e012 cpu.sch

.TP
Use mercurial to see all the changes since a specific revision
hg schdiff \-r 8442880f9835 cpld.sch

.TP
Use subversion to review a specific revision
svn diff \-\-diff-cmd lepton-schdiff \-c 49 power.sch
