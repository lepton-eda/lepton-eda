Analog  simulation used on frg-7700 repair.
This simulates one of the PLL's using a varactor.

FFT does a fft analysis on the vecs spicified. This is of course
complex and requires mag, just like bandpass example. You can also
just look at transient analysis which should be REAL and see the
wave form.  Both can be viewed with gaw, gwave or built in viewer
in ngpsice.

You will find the schematics and the custom symbols. The models
directory contain the models for the project.
