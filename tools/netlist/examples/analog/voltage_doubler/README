This is a Voltage doubler circuit. This includes three schematics.

-doubler_a
-doubler_b
-doubler_c

also is included the models in models directory.


The first of the three schematics

-doubler_a

is an example of using a single line model. The 'model-name'
attribute is defined as the name you wish to name he model and the
model is (one line) defined in the 'model' attribute.

-doubler_b

uses the attributes 'model-name' and 'file'. In 'model-name' you
define again the model-name and than define in 'file' the file
which contains the SPICE model to be used.

-doubler_c

The attributes used in this schematic are a SPICE model symbol
which defines the 'file' attribute which holds the name of the
file which contains the SPICE model. The device symbols contain
the 'model-name' attribute which connects to two together.

You should pick which method suits you best!
