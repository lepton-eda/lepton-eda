This simulation came about as I was fixing a FRG-7700 SSB radio.
It simulates the bandpass filter before the first RF amp.
The simulation should be run in NGSPICE.
It should show a bandpass responce.

You will find;

- reference material for frg_7700 in the directory.
- spice models for the simulaton in models directory.
- ngspice cmds used to run simulation.

You must also have gaw wave viewer` installed.

ac analysis results are complex so
vectors must be show as mag(vec) or db(vec) which is equivalent to
db(mag(vec)).

After writing file open file with gaw, set Abscissa (X) to Log
scale and display.
