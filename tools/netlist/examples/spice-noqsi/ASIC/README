This sample project demonstrates ASIC development using Lepton
with openIP.

The demo assumes you have ngspice installed. Typing "make" should
create netlists, run ngspice, and display a plot of the behavior
of a pulse height discriminator.

Some details:

This project handles hierarchy in SPICE rather than
lepton-netlist. Thus, hierarchy traversal is disabled in
configuration. This project uses the style of the older spice-sdb
back end for lepton-netlist.
