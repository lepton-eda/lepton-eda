.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBlepton-netlist\fR is a netlist extraction and generation tool, and is
part of the Lepton EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolset.  It takes
one or more electronic schematics as input, and outputs a netlist.  A
netlist is a machine-interpretable description of the way that
components in an electronic circuit are connected together, and is
commonly used as the input to a PCB layout program such as
\fBpcb\fR(1) or to a simulator such as \fBgnucap\fR(1).

A normal \fBlepton-netlist\fR run is carried out in two steps.  First, the
\fBlepton-netlist\fR frontend loads the specified human-readable schematic
\fIFILE\fRs, and compiles them to an in-memory netlist description.
Next, a `backend' is used to export the connection and component data
to one of many supported netlist formats.

\fBlepton-netlist\fR is extensible, using the Scheme programming language.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB-q\fR
Quiet mode. Turns off all warnings/notes/messages.
.TP 8

.TP 8
\fB-o\fR \fIFILE\fR
Specify the filename for the generated netlist.  By default, output is
directed to `output.net'.
If `-' is given instead of a filename, the output is directed to the
standard output.
.TP 8
\fB-l\fR \fIFILE\fR
Specify a Scheme file to be loaded before the backend is loaded or
executed.  This option can be specified multiple times.
.TP 8
\fB-m\fR \fIFILE\fR
Specify a Scheme file to be loaded between loading the backend and
executing it.  This option can be specified multiple times.
.TP 8
\fB-c\fR \fIEXPR\fR
Specify a Scheme expression to be executed during \fBlepton-netlist\fR
startup.  This option can be specified multiple times.
.TP 8
\fB-i\fR
After the schematic files have been loaded and compiled, and after all
Scheme files have been loaded, but before running the backend, enter a
Scheme read-eval-print loop.
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message.
.TP 8
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print \fBlepton-netlist\fR version information.
.TP 8
\fB--\fR
Treat all remaining arguments as schematic filenames.  Use this if you
have a schematic filename which begins with `-'.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
These examples assume that you have a `stack_1.sch' in the current directory.
.PP
\fBlepton-netlist\fR requires that at least one schematic to be specified on the
command line:

.nf
	./lepton-netlist stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
This is not very useful since it does not direct \fBlepton-netlist\fR to do
anything.
.PP
Specify a backend name with `\-g' to get \fBlepton-netlist\fR to output a
netlist:

.nf
	./lepton-netlist \-g geda stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
The netlist output will be written to a file called `output.net'
in the current working directory.

.PP
You can specify the output filename by using the `\-o' option:

.nf
	./lepton-netlist \-g geda stack_1.sch \-o /tmp/stack.netlist
.ad b

.PP
Output will now be directed to `/tmp/stack.netlist'.

.PP
You could run (for example) the `spice-sdb' backend against the
schematic if you specified `\-g spice-sdb', or you could generate a
bill of materials for the schematic using `\-g partslist1'.

.PP
To obtain a Scheme prompt to run Scheme expressions directly, you can
use the `\-i' option.

.nf
	./lepton-netlist \-i stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
\fBlepton-netlist\fR will load `stack_1.sh', and then enter an interactive
Scheme read-eval-print loop.
