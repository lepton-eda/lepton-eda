Bugs (no particular order):
--------------------------

	- If a component cannot be read, then this situation is not dealt
	  with.  Technically at this point, gnetlist can't do anything so
	  it really should exit.  Add code to do this later...

	- Memory leaks (lots right now) A LOT MORE now!

	- Ordering of pin outputs in spice netlist output for components like
	  BJT transistors B C E.  This is wrong for now. (might be fixed now)

	- (SPICE backend) It is possible to have named a net something (say 1)
	  and then have an unnamed net called 1 as well.  Obviously my
	  unnamed net naming is lame.

	- gnetlist:get-toplevel-attribute only looks for the first occurrence
	  of the toplevel attribute.  Make this somehow better?

	- Figure out why the post process screwed up net names when it was
	  done in the wrong place (after every sheet), low priority

	- gnetlist doesn't handle order very well on some machines?
	  non-linux only?

Finished stuff:
---------------

FIXED	Embedded schematics don't netlist at all.

OKAY	Infinite net connection loops.

FIXED  	Attach a label to a net which is going to no pin and it won't
        show up. (this is because mid point connections are not being
	dealt with properly...)
