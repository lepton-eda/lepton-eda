BOM - Bill Of Materials generater for gnetlist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (Matt) put together a quick bill of materials generator for gnetlist.
It takes a configuration file which tells it what attributes you want
netlisted (i.e. vendor, part number).

This is a sample config file:

device
label
name

Just call it with
        gnetlist  -g bom -o test.bom test.sch

The config file must be called "attribs" and be in the pwd, because
there is no way to pass arguments to the netlister (at least that I
could find).

Eventually I'd like to integrate this with some sort of a database for
production purposes.  Let me know if you are interested in helping or
have any ideas.
