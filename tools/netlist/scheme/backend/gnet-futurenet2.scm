;;; Notes about futurenet2 (.NV2) format pinlists
;;;
;;;  - Case does not seem to be preserved so to avoid issues,
;;;    simply output the netnames in all caps.
;;;
;;;  - Netname length is 8 characters max.  +,-, and _ are allowed
;;;
;;;  - How are DATA,3 and DATA,4 used?  In one example, DATA,4 is
;;;    not used.  In the other DATA,3 and DATA,4 are identical and
;;;    appear to be set to the value (10.0k for example) of the part.
;;;
;;;    From Ferenc Marton (martonf at datapress dot hu):
;;;
;;;    These get combined in Ranger2 to produce the device
;;;    description with a "," separating the two entries.
;;;    DATA,3 is the "device name", max of 5 characters
;;;    DATA,4 is the "device value", max of 13 characters.
;;;    We could put the footprint into DATA,4
;;;
;;;  - In the "PIN" and "SIG" lines, what are the various fields really
;;;    doing?
;;;
;;;    It seems that for a PIN line, the format is:
;;;
;;;    PIN,,<netname>,1-1,5,<net attribute number>,<pinnumber>
;;;
;;;    What are the "1-1" and the "5"?  On the <net attribute
;;;    number> I've seen "23", "25", and "100".  Maybe these
;;;    indicate signal vs power or some sort of routing preference?
;;;
;;;    For a SIG line, the format seems to be:
;;;
;;;    SIG,<netname>,1-1,5,<netname>
;;;
;;;    What exactly are "1-1" and "5"?  I think maybe the "1-1" part
;;;    has something to do with sheet number in a multipage schematic.
