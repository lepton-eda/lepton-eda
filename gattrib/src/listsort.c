 * Linked list sorting code taken from

 * and hacked to serve in gattrib by SDB.
 *----------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
 * Demonstration code for sorting a linked list.
 * 
 * The algorithm used is Mergesort, because that works really well
 * on linked lists, without requiring the O(N) extra space it needs
 * when you do it on arrays.
 * 
 * This code can handle singly and doubly linked lists, and
 * circular and linear lists too. For any serious application,
 * you'll probably want to remove the conditionals on `is_circular'
 * and `is_double' to adapt the code to your own purpose.
