Gattrib todos.

Updated 8.06.2004 -- SDB

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a running list of things left to be done with gattrib.  Items
already completed are marked with  #####. 

*  Fix key_press event handling so that arrow keys work intelligently
   when using gtk-2.2.
*  Decide what to do about "pins" editing:  How to save out chages?
   Right now "pins" are only displayed, they cannot be changed.
*  #####  Add "component pins" page to allow users to edit component pin attributes.
   This is useful to make sure that the pin attributess are correctly 
   set for use with PCB & other layout packages.
*  #####  Create separate comp_attrib and net_attrib variables. 
*  #####  Handle saving out of multi-page design so that it correctly saves
   individual pages back to their destination (i.e. page1.sch ->
   page1.sch, page2.sch -> page2.sch.)  Currently smashes all pages
   together.
*  Find out why it leaves "xterm" on the command prompt when you
   invoke the prog with no files on the cmd line.  
*  Change save menus to:  save project, save as, which cycles through
   pages and saves objects out on a page by page basis.
*  Incorporate a "close" item on the menu to close out the current
   project without quitting the whole application. 
*  flesh out net handling functions.  Need to more fully understand
   how nets work.  Note that they must be read in differently from
   components -- you need to read the whole project in before handling
   nets because each net segment is separate, but the net itself can span
   many components and pages. 
*  Add info about NETS and net attribs into NOTES.  
*  #####  Go over OBJECT struct data in NOTES -- is (ATTRIB
   *attached_to) info correct? 
*  ##### Implement sort of master lists.
*  Install text_entry widget below menu & above spreadsheet (like in Excel).
   Use this widget for text entry into cell, like in Excel.
*  #####  Fix problem where pages read at different times are not merged.
*  #####  re-write NOTES and documentation for project.
*  #####  Include gnumeric spreadsheet into DIST_EXTRA
*  make sure comments in each fcn are true
*  #####  Make sure all DEBUG printfs are accurate & give the correct fcn name.
*  Re-introduce I18N stuff where I took it out.
*  ##### clean out i_basic.c -- there are too many "if 0" regions in there.
*  ##### Change attrib update algorithm to write out both old, updated
   attribs as well as new ones for each component. 
*  #####  Fix segfault when run on OpticalReceiver without valgrind or
   GDB.  (Fix: free in wrong place was moved to correct place in
   gattrib.c) 
*  Eventually re-introduce hierarchy.  Important for nets.
*  Add in fcns dealing with nets spanning pages.
*  #####  Incorporate Dan's changes, including Makefile changes, warning
   stuff, and make sure prog doesn't segfault if no attributes are
   found. 
*  #####  gattribrc should be installed in RC dir as part of "make install".
*  #####  Enable horizontal resizing of window.  Currently can't shrink window
   to less than initial width.
*  Fix cells so that a long attrib string doesn't bleed into/overwrite 
   adjacent cells.  Maybe automatically size cell to fit text?  Problem is that
   "file" attributes can be very long.   
*  Per Ales, use the gtksheet stuff as a library instead of a bunch of source
   files.  Is this necessary?
*  User should be able to set attrib visibility.  How to implement & show?
*  Incorporate ability to add attrib columns.
