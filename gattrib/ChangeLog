2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gattrib.c: Changes made to enable correct opening
	of schematics in foreign directories.  Changes detailed 
	in libgeda ChangeLog.  

	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* x_dialog.c, s_toplevel.c:  Rewrote missing symbol dialog box
	so that only one box is thrown up in event of missing symbols.
	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* include/prototype.h, src/(s_attrib.c, s_sheet_data.c,
	s_table.c, s_toplevel.c,  x_dialog.c): New feature -- gattrib
	now handles slotted components correctly.
	
2005-01-22 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_toplevel.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_sheet_data, Makefile.am: 
	Fixed bug where pre-existing
	attribs were deleted instead of being replaced.  Added new fcn 
	in s_attrib.c as part of this bugfix.

	* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, include/x_menu.h,
	src/gattrib.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,src/gtksheet_2_2.c,
	src/x_dialog.c:  New feature -- check for unsaved chages
	before leaving program.

	* configure.ac:  Added --enable-debug as configure option.

	
2005-01-21 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix bug where only one
	page of design was searched for missing attribs.  Also updated
	missing_sym dialog box.
	
2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/(s_object.c, gattrib.c, s_toplevel.c,x_fileselect.c,
	x_dialog.c): Incorporated pop-up window which notifies
	user if a component is found with no sym file.
	
2004-12-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* lib/system-gattribrc.in:  Changed to refer to system-gafrc.

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Changed the call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to take
	the GEDA_VERSION so that packages get created with the right
	version number

	* src/s_toplevel.c, x_dialog.c: Added a few #ifdef HAS_GTK22 tests
	to get gattrib to build using gtk12.  The addition tests in x_dialog.c
	are probably okay, but the test in s_toplevel.c needs to be fixed
	properly.

	* Makefile.am: Added missing file to EXTRA_DIST variable

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-07-27  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Ported code to GTK+-2.X.  Re-wrote Makefile.am & configure.ac.  Split
	   gtksheet.c into two versions, one for GTK-1.2 and one for GTK-2.X.
	   (Both copied from gtkextra.sf.net.)
	
	*  Many fixes related to moving to GTK-2.X

	*  Incorporated Ales' fix for "for" loop which had i=i++ construct.

2004-07-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Eliminated spurious GTK warnings by testing for NULL in arguments 
	   before calling functions in gtksheet.c.

	*  Removed several extraneous files originally bundled with GtkSheet.

2004-06-25  Ales Hvezda  (Noted by SDB)

	*  Modified gattrib to work with soon-to-be-released libgeda 20040710.
	
2004-03-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Implemented alphabetic sort of master_comp_list.
	
	*  Placed references to g_rc_reset_component_library and other
	   Guile fcns into g_register to enable Sri's RC customized files.
	
2004-03-11  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Fixed bug in which a loop was terminating early, causing
	   large portions of some designs to be not processed.

	*  Added code to catch a cond where a design with no components
	   (i.e. no refdeses) or no modifiable attributes (i.e. no attribs
	   other than refdes) would cause a segfault.  Now program just
	   exits with an error message.
	
2004-03-06  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Fixed bug in which graphical objects were not discarded
	   during the "add master list" loop.  This generated a 
	   spurious warning message.

	*  Fixed configure.ac to fix the GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X problem
	   originally identified by Dan, and seen again by Sribalan 
	   Santhanam in rel 20040304.  Hopefully I fixed the bug this 
	   time! 
	
2004-03-04  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Fixed some compilation issues related to GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X.
	   Dan McMahill discovered the problem, and also provided the
	   patches fixing it.  Thanks, Dan!

	*  "make install" now correctly installs system-gattribrc into
	   the place where the gEDA RC files live.  I had forgotten to
	   include this into the last release, and you had to do it by
	   hand. 

2004-02-21  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Initial release.

2003-12-05  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* Started hacking.
