        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

	* src/g_rc.c, src/gattrib.c src/x_dialog.c: Added CUSTOM_VERSION to

	visibility of existing attributes.

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next

	upon attribute visibility.

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/*.c: Applied Patch#1533798: Remove pre-GTK2 code from geda

	g_object_unref to fix a valgrind error and the following 
	output when	
	exiting gattrib:  free(): invalid pointer 0x812a108!

	* src/gattrib.c, src/gtksheet_2_2.c, src/s_object.c, 
	src/s_rename.c, src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c, 
	src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c,
	src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Changed all malloc/free calls to
	g_malloc/g_free to be consistent with libgeda

2006-06-03 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* src/gtksheet_2_2.c: Finally fixed annoying bug in which gattrib
	soaked up 70% of processor time.  Problem had to do with infinite
	loop of expose_events generated upon call
	to gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) and 
	gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) in gtk_sheet_expose.  I
	removed calls to fix bug.

2006-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gattribrc.in: Removed load for the system-gafrc file,
        since it is loaded by libgeda first.

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/: gtkitementry_2_2.c, gtksheet_2_2.c: remove various compiler
          warnings

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a 
        temporary version and not a real release number.

2005-07-13 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* src/s_visibility.c, s_table.c, s_object.c, s_toplevel.c 
	amongst others.

	real variables in libgeda/noweb/i_vars.c.

2005-04-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* src/gtkitementry_1_2.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,
	  src/gtksheet_1_2.c src/gtksheet_2_2.c:
	  Fixed segmentation fault because lacking of "default_border" and 
	  "default_ouside_border" properties.

2005-04-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gattrib.c: Moved a variable decl to the top of the function to
	make gcc 2.96 happy.  

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error 		message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-11 12:30 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * src/gtksheet*.c:  Incorporated definitions of default_border* 
	as suggested by Carlos.  A couple other possible bugfixes also.

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

2005-03-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        filenames on the command line again.

2005-03-06 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_table.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix some uninitialized variables
	found by Dan McMahill & -wall gcc warning.
	
2005-02-21 05:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
	  include/x_menu.h, src/Makefile.am, src/gattrib.c, src/listsort.c,
	  src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c,
	  src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_gtksheet.c: Fix many
	  instances of non-void functions not having return values.  Most
	  of these were simply changed to void functions since nothing
	  seemed to be expecting a return value.  While here, garbage
	  collect several unused variables to make the compiler warnings
	  easier to dig through.  Also if we're using gcc, then turn on
	  -Wall.

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it's an
	  extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
	  systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gattrib.c (gattrib_main): Adapted for new logging system.

2005-02-19  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/globals.c: Added definition of picture_draw_func after 
	adding picture support to libgeda.
	
2005-02-15 18:32  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/x_dialog.c: Modified GTK buttons slightly so the captions 
	fit the button, and the button usage matches the text.

2005-02-14 22:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/: gtkextra-marshal.c, gtkitementry_1_2.c, listsort.c: add
	  some missing config.h inclusions

2005-02-14 22:27  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/x_dialog.c: - move the config.h inclusion higher up so the
	  protected inclusion of string.h doesn't fail.

	  - fix a format string/# of arguments mismatch in a warning
	  string.

2005-02-13 11:30  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_table.c: Fixed syntax bug (doubled ;;) in 
	s_table_add_toplevel_pin_items_to_pin_table.
	
2005-02-13 01:40  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/s_string_list.c: fix 2 places where a pointer to an int was
	  being cast to an int and used as an int when we really wanted to
	  dereference the pointer instead.

2005-02-12  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gattrib.c, src/i_vars.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c,

	dialog stay on top of main window when gattrib is invoked with
	no args on cmd line.
	
2005-02-12  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Beautify buttons (use GTK stock).
	
2005-02-08 12:33  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* include/prototype.h, src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c, src/gattrib.c:
	  get rid of deprecated guile gh_* functions and replace them with
	  the currently (guile-1.6) supported interface.

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gattrib.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_object.c:
	* src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c, src/s_table.c:
	* src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c:
	* src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Replaced u_basic_strdup() and 
	u_basic_strdup_multiple() by GLib functions.
	
	* src/gattrib.c, src/x_fileselect.c:  Made it use GLib's 
	G_DIR_SEPARATOR* instead of libgeda's *_SEPARATER_*.

2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gattrib.c: Changes made to enable correct opening
	of schematics in foreign directories.  Changes detailed 
	in libgeda ChangeLog.  

	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* x_dialog.c, s_toplevel.c:  Rewrote missing symbol dialog box
	so that only one box is thrown up in event of missing symbols.
	
2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* include/prototype.h, src/(s_attrib.c, s_sheet_data.c,
	s_table.c, s_toplevel.c,  x_dialog.c): New feature -- gattrib
	now handles slotted components correctly.
	
2005-01-22 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/s_toplevel.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_sheet_data, Makefile.am: 
	Fixed bug where pre-existing
	attribs were deleted instead of being replaced.  Added new fcn 
	in s_attrib.c as part of this bugfix.

	* include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, include/x_menu.h,
	src/gattrib.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,src/gtksheet_2_2.c,
	src/x_dialog.c:  New feature -- check for unsaved chages
	before leaving program.

	* configure.ac:  Added --enable-debug as configure option.

	
2005-01-21 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix bug where only one
	page of design was searched for missing attribs.  Also updated
	missing_sym dialog box.
	
2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/(s_object.c, gattrib.c, s_toplevel.c,x_fileselect.c,
	x_dialog.c): Incorporated pop-up window which notifies

2004-12-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* lib/system-gattribrc.in:  Changed to refer to system-gafrc.

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Changed the call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to take
	the GEDA_VERSION so that packages get created with the right
	version number

	* src/s_toplevel.c, x_dialog.c: Added a few #ifdef HAS_GTK22 tests
	to get gattrib to build using gtk12.  The addition tests in x_dialog.c
	are probably okay, but the test in s_toplevel.c needs to be fixed
	properly.

	* Makefile.am: Added missing file to EXTRA_DIST variable

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-07-27  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Ported code to GTK+-2.X.  Re-wrote Makefile.am & configure.ac.  Split
	   gtksheet.c into two versions, one for GTK-1.2 and one for GTK-2.X.
	   (Both copied from gtkextra.sf.net.)
	
	*  Many fixes related to moving to GTK-2.X

	*  Incorporated Ales' fix for "for" loop which had i=i++ construct.

2004-07-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Eliminated spurious GTK warnings by testing for NULL in arguments 
	   before calling functions in gtksheet.c.

	*  Removed several extraneous files originally bundled with GtkSheet.

2004-06-25  Ales Hvezda  (Noted by SDB)

	*  Modified gattrib to work with soon-to-be-released libgeda 20040710.
	
2004-03-13  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Implemented alphabetic sort of master_comp_list.
	
	*  Placed references to g_rc_reset_component_library and other
	   Guile fcns into g_register to enable Sri's RC customized files.
	
2004-03-11  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Fixed bug in which a loop was terminating early, causing
	   large portions of some designs to be not processed.

	*  Added code to catch a cond where a design with no components
	   (i.e. no refdeses) or no modifiable attributes (i.e. no attribs
	   other than refdes) would cause a segfault.  Now program just
	   exits with an error message.
	
2004-03-06  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	*  Fixed bug in which graphical objects were not discarded
	   during the "add master list" loop.  This generated a 
	   spurious warning message.

	*  Fixed configure.ac to fix the GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X problem
	   originally identified by Dan, and seen again by Sribalan 
	   Santhanam in rel 20040304.  Hopefully I fixed the bug this 
	   time! 
	
2004-03-04  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Fixed some compilation issues related to GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X.
	   Dan McMahill discovered the problem, and also provided the
	   patches fixing it.  Thanks, Dan!

	*  "make install" now correctly installs system-gattribrc into
	   the place where the gEDA RC files live.  I had forgotten to
	   include this into the last release, and you had to do it by
	   hand. 

2004-02-21  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
	
	*  Initial release.

2003-12-05  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* Started hacking.
