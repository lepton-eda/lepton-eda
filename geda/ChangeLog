        release.

2006-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version number to 20060821 in prep for the
        next gEDA/gaf release.

2006-03-02 Stuart Brorson <sdb [AT] cloud9 [DOT] net>

	file chooser to GtkFileSelectorWhatever ....  Moved filesel.[ch] to
	filechoose.[ch]. 
	
2006-01-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* po/*: auto* tools update all po files for distribution.

2006-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* autogen.sh, m4/gettext.m4: Removed files from CVS since they are
	installation specific

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123

2005-09-27 18:46  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * graphman/configfile.c, src/configfile.c: remove various compiler
          warnings

2005-09-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/it.po: Updated the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.

2005-08-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/it.po: Updated the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.

2005-08-20 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	* po/de_DE.pe: updated translation

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a 
        temporary version and not a real release number.

2005-05-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/task.c: Fixed a nasty crash.  In StrReplace(), realloc
	may return a completely new pointer which needs to be assigned
	and used.  This modified pointer also needed to be returned
	from StrReplace().  Note, gManager will not quite work right with
	files (schematics/pcb/etc...) that do not live in the project 
	directory.  This bug was logged against the debian packages.

2005-03-25 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
	* src/project.c: added file check, geda hang if theres no file
	  selection or selection is a directory (Bug #156)

2005-03-19 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

	* po/de_DE.po, po/LINGUAS: added german translation

	* src/main.c, src/support.h: fixed encoding problem with UTF-8
	charactors

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error 
        message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

	* src/tool.c: Commented out enum which was unused and caused a 
	seg fault for certain users.  Probably because there isn't an
	equivalent entry in the ExtList data structure.

2005-03-10 22:32  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac: add dmalloc and Electric Fence debugging support.

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

2005-02-21 14:18  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* graphman/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: add -g -O that I managed
	  to drop by mistake

2005-02-21 05:36  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, graphman/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am:
	  conditionalize the use of lots of gcc specific compiler flags on
	  the compiler actually being gcc.  Should give this a chance with
	  non-gcc compilers.

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it's an
	  extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
	  systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* geda/po/it.po, LINGUAS: Added new updated Italian translation by
	Marco Colombo.  Thanks.  (renamed it_IT.po translation to it.po).

2005-02-12 22:06  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* graphman/Makefile.am, graphman/callbacks.c, graphman/config.c,
	  graphman/config.h, graphman/configfile.c, graphman/configfile.h,
	  graphman/export2gwave.c, graphman/filetool.c, graphman/graph.c,
	  graphman/libstring.c, graphman/main.c, graphman/msgbox.c,
	  graphman/raw2gw.c, graphman/support.c, graphman/value.c,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/callbacks.c, src/config.c, src/config.h,
	  src/configfile.c, src/configfile.h, src/doc.c, src/file.c,
	  src/filesel.c, src/filetool.c, src/interface.c, src/l_toolbar.c,
	  src/log.c, src/m_action.c, src/m_file.c, src/m_project.c,
	  src/m_window.c, src/main.c, src/msgbox.c, src/project.c,
	  src/task.c, src/tool.c, src/txtedit.c, src/window.c: rename
	  config.{c,h} to configfile.{c,h} inside src/ and graphman/ to
	  avoid issues with . and .. being in the search path and needing
	  to pull in the top level config.h file.  Also clean up inclusion
	  of the configure generated config.h and protect the inclusion of
	  a couple of headers with the configure tests.

2005-02-12  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/interface.c: Beautify buttons (use GTK stock).
	
2005-02-03 23:04  danmc

	* src/m_file.c: - lots of clean up of 'const' usage.  Seems to have
	  squished all	 gcc warnings around const.  Mostly this involved
	  adding lots of   missing const's.  - also add a few missing
	  prototypes and header files.	- fix call to realpath (it was
	  being given a pointer to a pointer rather   than a pointer).

2005-02-03 12:43  danmc

	* src/m_file.c: use stdlib.h instead of malloc.h

2005-02-03 12:28  danmc

	* src/doc.c: Use stdlib.h instead of malloc.h to get malloc/free
	  prototypes as the former is more standard.  Should fix OS-X
	  compilation problems.

2005-01-17 01:09  danmc

	* graphman/Makefile.am: add missing @LIBINTL@ to graphman_LDADD

2005-01-17 00:41  danmc

	* graphman/callbacks.c, graphman/libstring.c, graphman/main.c,
	  src/doc.c: add missing header includes

2005-01-17 00:41  danmc

	* src/callbacks.c: add a return value to avoid compiler warnings.
	  As it turns out we shouldn't ever get here anyway, but we
	  increase the SNR of the compiler output.

2005-01-17 00:40  danmc

	* graphman/config.c: add missing type for cSeparator

2005-01-16 21:24  danmc

	* graphman/raw2gw.c: use posix getcwd() instead of gnu extension
	  get_current_dir_name()

2005-01-16 21:15  danmc

	* src/Makefile.am: add missing @LIBINTL@ to geda_LDADD

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/it_IT.po: Added the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.
	Thanks!

	* po/fr_FR.po: Added French translation by Iznogood. Thanks!

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-09-19 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * configure.ac, src/*, graphman/*: Update for compiling with both Gtk 1.2 and 2.2

        * graphman/ directory: a new tool for managing graphs (first attempt without plot definition).

2004-07-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040710

2004-01-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * config.h.in: Remove machine generated file.

2004-01-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

2004-01-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Added checks for time.h and nanosleep.  nanosleep
	is used in the sleep function below.

	* src/main.c: Added a sleep function inside the main loop to reduce
	the CPU load.  Without this sleep, the while loop keeps the cpu
	100% busy.  With the sleep, the geda process spends more time 
	sleeping, hence lower CPU load.  This sleep will only occur on 
	systems which support nanosleep.

2003-12-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

        * m4/Makefile.am: Added some missing *.m4 files to EXTRA_DIST.

2003-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Removed machine generated file from CVS

	* graphman/.cvsignore, m4/.cvsignore: Added cvs ignore files to 
	minimize cvs update's chatter.

	* po/.cvsignore, intl/.cvsignore: Updated files with new files
	from gettext 0.12.1

        * configure.ac: Updated to gettext 0.12.1

2003-12-11 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * src/project.c, src/doc.c, src/doc.h: Added saving project
        files with project properties (small changes in project file
        format).

        * src/filetool.c: Bug fixed: project was saved with wrong filename
        (last letter disappeared).
        
        * graphman directory, graphman/raw2gw.c, graphman/Makefile.am,
        Makefile.am, configure.ac: Added graphman directory, temporarly
        with only an obsolete raw2gw.
        
2003-12-09 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * src/interface.c, src/interface.h, src/m_project.c, src/m_project.h,
        src/callbacks.c: Project window connected. No full support for it
        (properties are not saved).
        
2003-12-08 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * src/Makefile.am, src/interface.c, src/interface.h, src/callbacks.h,
        src/m_file.c, src/m_file.h, src/file.c, src/file.h, src/tool.c:
        Added new File->New window.
        
2003-12-05 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * src/doc.c, src/project.c, src/project.h, src/m_project.c,
        src/m_project.h: added support for project properties window
        (not connected yet), small changes in project file format.
        
2003-12-02 Piotr Miarecki   <tertul@poczta.onet.pl>

        * src/global.h, src/main.c: Added function FatalError() and
        default project values.
        
2003-11-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* config.guess config.rpath config.sub depcomp mkinstalldirs
	missing install-sh stamp-h.in: Removed machine generated scripts 
	from CVS

        version is not an official release.

2003-10-02 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/*.c: Added an #include "../config.h" to all files a required
	by the general ./configure mechanism.  

	* src/Makefile.am: Corrected the localedir define

2003-09-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

=== 0.2 ===

Released january 13, 2003.

As version 0.1 has appeared to be totally not functional, this is a first
version that can be used be users. It has only basic functions to manage
projects, files and run tools. Commonly used actions are accessible from
the menu. 

Do not expect that everything will work good together. Major problems are
with:

* PCB - in RedHat distribution m4 is located not in /usr/local/bin what
  is default location used by PCB, gnetlisted schematics are not loaded
  by PCB. 
  
* gwave - can display only transient results.

* verilog - problems with simulation "multifile" modules.

etc.

=== 0.1 ===

First attempt.
