README for Project Manager 2006* 


gEDA Suite Project Manager is a start point for everything what you may
want to do. It is used to organize your files and easy running tools. It
simplifies your job.

There is a menu at the top of the window. Main area of Project Manager
window is divided into three parts:

	* Project Browser - there are your files enumerated here. In a
	  Modules view you can see project hierarchy, in a Files view -
	  files sorted in disk folders.

	* Workspace - there are your files opened here. Listing of opened
	  files is shown under Window menu.

	* Status Area - effects of your actions will be shown here.

gEDA Suite is strongly project oriented. It means that you cannot work
with files without creating a project. To force it, workspace and status
area are inactive when no project is loaded.

If you have a project saved on the disk, choose Project -> Open. A
new dialog window - File Selection -will be opened. Choose a directory
where project files is stored, click or type a name of the project file,
then press Ok.

To create a new project choose Project -> New from the menu. A new dialog
window - File Selection -will be opened. Choose a desired directory where
project files should be stored, a name of the new project file, then press
Ok. The name has to be ended with .prj. The new project should be created.

Now the project is opened, its name is displayed in a title bar and
menus are activated. You can add, remove, open, etc. files.

Some of those actions can modify your project, then an asteriks * will
be added to the project name on the title bar. It informs you that you
have to save the project choosing Project -> Save from the menu. If
you try to close the project or exit Project Manager without saving,
a warning will be displayed.

After completing your job please close the project choosing Project ->
Close from the menu.

If a project is opened, you can add files to the project and work with
them.  Only files of registered types can be added. For any of them a set
of possible actions is defined. There are also some file types generated
and imported automatically after running actions. They cannot be added
manually to the project.

All registered files types are listed below:

To add a new file to the project choose File -> New, then select a type of
added file. To add an existing file choose File -> Import. In both cases
a new dialog - File Selection - will be opened. Go to desired directory,
then click or type a name of the file, then press Ok. Remeber that the
file has to have its extension as mentioned in the table above!

To remove a file from the project, click its name in Project Browser
and choose File -> Unlink from the menu. The file will stay on the
disk. To completely delete the file, choose File -> Delete. In both
cases a warning will be displayed.

Files selected in Project Browser can be opened, edited and used for other
actions. Majority of files are ASCII ones. They can be edited as a text
in builtin text editor. To edit a file choose File -> Edit from the menu.

To open a file select it in Project Browser, then choose Action -> Open
form the menu. You can double click the file in Project Browser as well.

Files can be opened in internal or external tools. If an internal one is
used - the file will be displayed as a new window in the Workspace. If
external one is used - a new tool will be runned. All opened files are
listed in Window menu.  You can switch between internally opened windows
choosing its name in the Window menu.

To close an internally opened file - choose it from the Window menu,
then choose File -> Close. If the file is modified and not saved,
a warning will be displayed.

Files opened and modified should be saved with File -> Save. A file
currently opened in the workspace will be saved.
