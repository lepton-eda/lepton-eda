README for icon data

This file describes where the various icons came from and their license.

The schematic and symbol mimetype icons and registration data were
contrinuted by Tomaz Solc, and subsequently modified by Peter Clifton,
including creation of a gsch2pcb icon in a simlar style. The page outline
is from the GNOME icon theme's text-x-generic icon by Jakub Steiner.

The icons are licensed under the GPL2 license.

Scalable versions: (128x128 canvas for the "hicolor" fallback theme).
These were scaled up from the 48x48 pixel targeted version.
