;;; This script is launched by autotools like this:
;;; (test.scm --test-name file.scm
;;;           --log-file file.log
;;;           --trs-file file.trs
;;;           --color-tests no
;;;           --enable-hard-errors yes
;;;           --expect-failure no
;;;           -- -L . unit-tests/file.scm)
;;;
;;;
;;; autotools expect the output .trs file contain the info as
;;; follows:
;;;
;;; :test-result: value
;;;   May be used several times, say, for several procedures. Its
;;;   value must be one of: "PASS", "XFAIL", "SKIP", "FAIL",
;;;   "XPASS", "ERROR" and optionally some text after it.
;;;
;;; :recheck: value
;;;   Must be present once or not present at all. If its value is
;;;   "no", 'make recheck' won't run the corresponding test. Since
;;;   I don't know if this would be useful, let's set it to "yes"
;;;   (we could just omit it as well).
;;;
;;; :copy-in-global-log: value
;;;   Must be present once. I believe the best value for it is
;;;   "no", so we won't double log info for each test.
;;;
;;; :test-global-result: value
;;;   Must be present once if several tests are done in one
;;;   script. It should output some summary.
