When running the tests under gdb or valgrind, use the `libtool'
script, as in:

$ ./libtool --mode=execute gdb tests/storage/some_test

To run the test suite under valgrind, pass the libtool/valgrind
invocation as the LOG_COMPILER variable:

$ make check LOG_COMPILER="../libtool --mode=execute \
			   valgrind --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1"

You can select a subset of the tests by adding TESTS="test1 test2 ...".
